blurb = "Jamie had been dipping his toes into Frother's football. for a year or two before committing to the 2021/22 summer league. Highly regarded amongst the Hamilton battlers, Jamie started to show what all the fuss was about as he regained his confidence on the pitch and became a real operator in the middle of the park. Jamie is a natural fit for the Frothers, with good humour, salt and pepper, and a baby on the way."

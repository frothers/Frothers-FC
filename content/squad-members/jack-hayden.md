blurb = "A regular from the 2021/22 summer league, Jack joined the Frothers in the 2022 season for his official rookie year. Jack is cementing the age old tradition of having at least one true Englishman every kiwi footballing team. The man from Newcastle has shown a aptitude for playing in the fullback positions and even brings a left foot to the backline. Bagging a couple of goals when given the chance up top the fans will be watching in anticipation about what Jack will bring to the Frothers."

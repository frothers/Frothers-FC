Preseason and the boys were back to show off the work the had been doing over the break.

Playing a Mark Ave team who's results are almost a consistent as the Frothers the game was bound to be entertaining if nothing else.

A few new signings included some familiar faces. Salty signed on after flirting last season. Craig and Patrick came through the friend of a friend route and we're looking to impress.

Disaster struck Patrick Just minutes into the game, after rocking Farshid to the core with the revelation that he is a teenager before the match. Losing half a tooth spelled the end for the young blood.

Mark Ave opened the scoring with a hopeful long range effort. A low shot which you would normally back Ryan to scoop up slipped between the pins. In fairness I'm currently trying to touch my toes and now know it is outside the human body's design.

> 0-1

It didn't take the Frothers long to equalise. Some good linkup play up top found Yash at the back post with a simple finish.

> 1-1

The first third finished up level and the second third went without a goal. A fair few Frothers corners though.

Going back into the wind in the third allowed the Frothers to find their rhythm again. Yash managed to find the defence over-committed and was able to bridge the last man and finish under the keeper for his second.

> 2-1

Salty was found on the edge of the box and managed to chip the ball over the keeper to extend the lead.

> 3-1

In a late flash of brilliance, Farshid received the ball in the middle of the park and let fly a stinger that the keeper could only parry into his own net.

> 4-1

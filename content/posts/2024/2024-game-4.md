Trentham has the reputation as the Stoke of Wellington and this was the equivalent of the distance Derby for the Frothers.

The tone of the match was set straight from Kickoff as dark blue played purple meaning peripheral vision wasn't going to cut it. This paired with a bobbly grass pitch meant that the Frothers fluid midfield transitions were few and far between.

The boys still were able to make headway, a repelled ball fell to **Salty** who could trap and hit it through the keeper to get the lead.

> 1-0

The Frothers started getting a bit more confident and **Yarride** managed to turn in the box just in time for the keeper to have a bite and conceed a penalty. With $10 on the line **Yarride** was a little hesitant to take the penalty, but he need not have worried.

> 2-0

Trentham were able to make the most of one of their attacks with a seemingly endless dribble that resulted in a curled shot around **Ryan**.

> 2-1

The Frothers were able to get the two goal leaf back quickly. A beautiful lofted ball over the top by Fashids Ringin just missed Yarride, went under the keeper, and sat for **Lance** to tap home

> 3-1

## Halftime

Nothing really happened in the second half apart from a load of missed chances.

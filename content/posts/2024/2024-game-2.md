The Frothers return with a bang!

## First Half

The game kicked off with the Frothers playing some possession football. Far less hairy than last week, the Frothers midfield and backline were ticking along well.

The first goal was courtesy of a handy deflection off **Bunting's** shot, but the Frothers were willing to take it any way they could.

## Half-time.

## Man of the Match

The Frothers were only in the game after 20 minutes thanks to Ryan,  who made multiple 1-on-1 saves and diving saves to keep the match level.

## Dick of the Day

With Yarride back, the fines were back on the table. This was too much for some boys, with Ian fighting tooth and nail about whether a single shoe was exercise equipment. Long arguments were put forth, but the fact that Yarride specifically said shoes were off limits at the pre-season social made it a cut and dry case.

The Frothers return with a bang!

## First Half

The game kicked off with the Frothers playing some possession football. Far less hairy than last week, the Frothers midfield and backline were ticking along well.

The first goal was courtesy of a handy deflection off **Bunting's** shot, but the Frothers were willing to take it any way they could.

> 1-0

**Yash** was then freed down the right and pressed into the box. Haters will say it was a cross, but it was into the back of the net.

> 3-0

## Half-time

The boys were feeling comfortable and wanted to test their ability to control a match in the second half.

It didn't take long to extend the lead. Bunting hit a shot off from under the crossbar.

> 4-0

The boys then took off ðŸš€ and put on a show for the fans that came down.

Special shout-outs for Ian, scoring his first Frothers goal(s).

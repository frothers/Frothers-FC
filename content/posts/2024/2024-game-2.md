The Frothers return with a bang!

## First Half

The game kicked off with the Frothers playing some possession football. Far less hairy than last week, the Frothers midfield and backline were ticking along well.

The first goal was courtesy of a handy deflection off **Bunting's** shot, but the Frothers were willing to take it any way they could.

> 1-0

**Yarride** then got through on goal and did that Yarride thing.

> 2-0

**Yash** was then freed down the right and pressed into the box. Haters will say it was a cross, but it was into the back of the net.

> 3-0

## Half-time

The boys were feeling comfortable and wanted to test their ability to control a match in the second half.

It didn't take long to extend the lead. **Bunting** hit a shot off from under the crossbar.

> 4-0

The boys then took off ðŸš€ and put on a show for the fans that came down.

Special shout-outs for **Ian**, scoring his first Frothers goal(s) and **Patrick Moore** for his debut.

## Man of the Match

**Ian**, for making some great runs down the wing resulting in him scoring his first Frothers goals. Plus for bankrolling the team.

## Dick of the Day

**Yash**, for  having a cry at an obvious offside, denying bunting a hat trick by being greedy when he already had 3 himself, and faffing around with his shin pads when the game had already started.

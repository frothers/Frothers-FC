Running out in the Blue kit against our purple brothers, Mark Ave. After a weeks break and a long weekend the boys were desperate to get back into it.

The Frothers needed a win to keep pressure on the top of the table, but a new look Mark ave had different ideas.

## First Half

Mark ave were targeting the right wing relentlessly to free the pace of Will Sule. Finally the breakthrough came.

> 0-1

The Frothers were pressing hard for an equaliser. Lance providing a low cross for Salty to level it up.

> 1-1

A perfectly weighted freekick from deep was then floated in by Yarride, finding Evan who channelled his inner Zlatan to magically chip the keeper off the outside of theboot.

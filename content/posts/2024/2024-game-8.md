Big poppa is back with the match report and another great result for the Frothers.

On the morning of Man Utds FA cup win, **Charles** thought this was the opportune moment to show his face again. Bringing a chilly bin, empty of course, and first aid kit.

## First half

The boys kicked off and got into the match quick. Starting the scoring was **Yash**, a great piece of built up play from his brother, **Yarride** to put him through on goal.

> 1-0

The Pelicans then levelled it up with a good strike from their CB, sending a powerful hit to **Ryan's** left.

> 1-1

After a bit of time at stalemate the Frothers got back into action. **Salty** broke the offside trap from a ball from **Bunting** and put the ball over the head of the onrushing keeper.

> 2-1

The boys smelt goals in the air. Never one to miss out on some stat padding ,**Yash** tore down the right and sent a rocket shot in off the far post.

> 3-1

Bringing out an old Frothers favourite, the long goal kick once again paid dividends. Skimmed off the defender's head for **Lance** to chase down and put around the keeper.

> 4-1

**Yash** wasn't done yet. Not getting out of bed for anything less than a Hattrick, a touch and finish in the box.

> 5-1

## Halftime

The second half saw the Pelicans up the pressure and make the Frothers start to get frustrated at progressing the ball.

They did get back to scoring ways with the use of a throw in, several missed headers, and an opportunistic **Ian** running in and volleying past the keeper.

> 6-1

The Pelicans hit back right away with a great run through the backline and a cool finish.

> 6-2

The Frothers decided it was time to get nasty again and pull out the throwin game. More carnage led to **Yash** flicking it on and then **Lance** getting his head to the ball first.

> 7-2

The Pelicans got another one for the road.

> 7-3

## MotM

**Yash** put the game to bed in the first half and kept the pressure on in the race for golden boot for both him and **Lance** through an assist.

## DotD

The TAB were paying lousy odds on **Farshid** to add to his tally this season and the man didn't disappoint, with some coach-killing failed skill moves while being the last man.

**Salty**, however, came in with a late pull. Coked up from Man Utds win, he threw a cheap shot at one of the boys' mum. Shocking.

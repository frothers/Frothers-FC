Looking to get back to winning ways, the Frothers were playing Supper Paddys who are 3rd on the table.

## First Half

The Frothers were running a 5-3-2 formation and kicked off into another headwind.

Super Paddy's were the first team to strike, picking the defence's pocket and playing in the last man.

> 0-1

It was going to be hard work for the Frothers to get back into it with the wind against them. The Frothers came close twice to going two behind, with a corner that came off the back post and a great 1-on-1 save from Ryan.

The Frothers got back into the game with a cross from one wide back **James** to the other, **Patrick M** who headed home to level things up.

> 1-1

Not long after, it was **Patrick** who turned supplier. Crossing in a delightful ball to **Bunting**, who volleyed it first time to take the lead.

> 2-1

Coming to the end of the half, **Bunting** was in again. Cut down in his prime, the Frothers had a penalty. **Lance** stepped up to make it a 2 goal cushion going into the break.

> 3-1

## Second half

The Frothers had the wind and the legs to step up for a second half fiesta.

**Yarride** was able to put a free-kick on the keeper, and a following in **Patrick C** was able to mop-up the rebound.

> 4-1

**Bunting** was through next, hitting a short hard into the far post.

> 5-1

**Lance** then bagged his second with a nice little toe poke to finish off a driving run.

> 6-1

**Yarride** then got in on the action, side footing a low cross from Ian.

> 7-1

Super Paddy's pulled one back by unlocking the offside trap. Some of the Frothers backline were incensed, sure Ange ball would save them.

> 7-2

The Frothers weren't done. **Farshid** making a weaving run into the box to lay it off to **Yarride** for his second.

> 8-2

## Man of the Match

Plenty of goals and good performances to choose from today. **Patrick Moore** gets back to back awards. Breaking the game apart when we needed it most.

## Dick of the Day

Refusing to practice or even properly warm-up. **Chris** gets the award for skying a free kick into the Prefabs behind the goal and immediately subbing himself.

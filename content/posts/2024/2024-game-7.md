In a match-up that had all the makings of a classic, Frothers FC in their regal purple clashed with the undefeated Didier Koffi squad, draped in a rather envious green.

The day began with the lads showing up in their favourite club jerseys—everyone except **Lance**, who couldn't bear to wear his Man U shirt after their recent catastrophe. **Farshid**, sporting his best Arsène Wenger impression due to a head injury hiatus, stepped up to manage the squad.

## 1st half

The game kicked off on an even keel, with **Farshid** on the sidelines dispensing managerial wisdom like a seasoned maestro. **Bunting**, making his triumphant return after a few weeks, played like Pirlo reincarnated, scrapping for every ball and threading passes that could cut glass. His tenacity earned him a yellow card, which he wore like a badge of honour.

Just as the first half was drawing to a close, disaster struck. **Chris**, under the sort of pressure usually reserved for tax season, made a feeble back pass to **Ryan**. Despite **Ryan's** heroic clearance attempt, the ball ricocheted off the striker and dribbled into the net. Devastated by his mistake, **Chris** departed the game at halftime in a cascade of tears.

> 1-0

## 2nd half

The second half began with a stroke of managerial genius. **Salty** was redeployed to the back line to shore up the defence, and Frothers FC hit the ground running. **Ian** and **Jacob** turned the wings into their personal expressways, zooming up and down like caffeinated cheetahs. Despite yellow cards for **Doube** and **Yarride**, the team pressed on relentlessly. Frothers even managed to score, only for the referee to disallow it for offside. Clearly, the ref's guide dog missed that one.

**Farshid** and his trusty assistant **Yarride** were on the sidelines, deep in tactical discussions that probably involved top-secret hand signals. Frothers launched cross after cross into Didier's box, bombarding them like the Germans over London, each one more threatening than the last.

In the dying moments of the game, **Milan**, channelling his inner thief, stole the ball from the opposition and sent a breathtaking pass to **Salty**. With the grace of a ballet dancer and the power of a trebuchet, **Salty** volleyed a cross from the halfway line. **Yarride**, defying the laws of physics, soared through the air and hammered home a header that was so Puskas-worthy it could make grown men weep. The ball crashed into the net from **Yarride's** head like the Iranian president into a mountain.

> 1-1

The game ended 1-1, with Frothers FC snatching a draw from the jaws of defeat.

## Man of the Match

**Salty**, for his phenomenal performance both in attack and defence, capped off by a last-minute assist. The man is on fire, surely gunning for the Ballon d'Or with his relentless scoring and assisting.

## Dick of the Day

**Chris**, for his unfortunate mistake that led to Didier's goal and his tearful exit at halftime. He played valiantly in the first half, but sometimes the beautiful game can be a cruel mistress.

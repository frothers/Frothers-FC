The Frothers were treated to a grass pitch at Naenae college this week. The first time playing on grass in years was sure to be a test to the pampered gentry of the Frother's ranks.

**Salty** got the game up and running, luring some 60kg Chinese United players into dicey 50/50s. The ref wasn't impressed and called a dubious foul, setting the tone for the match.

It didn't take the Frothers long to breakthrough, however. **Lance** was through on goal to find the keeper in no man's land. A easy sidefoot into the unprotected goal was all that was needed.

> 1-0

It didn't take long for Chinese United to hit back, Ronnie respawn scythed through the back line to force a good save from **Ryan**, however the player following up was able to bundle it home.

> 1-1

The game stalled a bit from there, with neither side able to setup fluid play. Not helped by a whistle Happy referee.

## Halftime

Halftime saw the introduction of another brother, *Alex Rayns*.

More hard work in the second half resulted in the quintessential stone wall penalty as **Alex** was through on goal.

After a bit of debate about who should take it *Lance* stepped up, only to call **Chris** up from deep to take it.

Smacking the ball in off the upright (or something like that) the Frothers were back ahead.

> 2-1

The lead didn't last for all that long. A soft freekick was given away on the edge of the box. A good lofted ballin found a leaping player who headed the ball off the crossbar, again there was a player there to finish the deflection.

> 2-2

In one of the last plays of the game a freekick was won in a dangerous position for the Frothers. **Yarride** stepped up to do the honours, with the goal of keeping it on target. It proved to be all that was required. As **Yarride** turned away in disgust the keeper fumbled it into the path of **Lance** who scored his second.

> 3-2

## Man of the Match

**Farshid**, Cut out a lot of attacks and also played some nice balls through the middle on attack. Second half he went to full back and did heaps of running, trying to get us moving forward. Plus any excuse to use this image.

## Dick of the Day

**Salty** picks up the honours for creating a hostile work environment.

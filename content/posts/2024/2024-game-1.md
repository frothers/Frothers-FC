Back with a 6 goal thriller to start the season off.

With the Sunday league down to a meagre 20 teams across a single division, there is bound to be a mix of talent. Happy Feet proved they could keep up the calibre with a strong display.

## First Half

The game kicked off with Happy Feet firmly on the front foot, with a handful of great saves the only thing keeping the game level.

The Frothers started to get a bit more of a grip on the game, and returning Frothers legend, Yarride, did what he does best. Finishing over the top of the keeper after some football ping pong in the box.

> 1-0

## Half-time

A slight change in tactics at half-time, moving to a double pivot in midfield. This seems to pay off as the Frothers had a lot more control of the game. Doubling the lead through a questionable offside call, with Yarride again through on goal from a pass by Doube.

> 2-0

The Frother had several chances to put the game to bed, but missed some great opportunities.

This came back to bite as the game wore on, and the Frothers ran out of steam.

A breakaway counterattack started the comeback. With a followed up free-kick that come off the bar, Happy Feet tied up the game up.

They kept coming, and won a penalty to take the lead, and then opened a 4-2 lead up with a fine long range effort.

## Man of the Match

The Frothers were only in the game after 20 minutes thanks to Ryan,  who made multiple 1-on-1 saves and diving saves to keep the match level.

## Dick of the Day

With Yarride back, the fines were back on the table. This was too much for some boys, with Ian fighting tooth and nail about whether a single shoe was exercise equipment. Long arguments were put forth, but the fact that Yarride specifically said shoes were off limits at the pre-season social made it a cut and dry case.

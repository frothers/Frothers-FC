Preseason and the boys were back to show off the work the had been doing over the break.

Playing a Mark Ave team who's results are almost a consistent as the Frothers the game was bound to be entertaining if nothing else.

A few new signings included some familiar faces. **Salty** signed on after flirting last season. **Craig** and **Patrick** came through the friend of a friend route and we're looking to impress.

Disaster struck **Patrick** Just minutes into the game, after rocking **Farshid** to the core with the revelation that he is a teenager before the match. Losing half a tooth spelled the end for the young blood.

Mark Ave opened the scoring with a hopeful long range effort. A low shot which you would normally back **Ryan** to scoop up slipped between the pins. In fairness, I'm currently trying to touch my toes and now know it is outside the human body's design.

> 0-1

It didn't take the Frothers long to equalise. Some good linkup play up top found **Yash** at the back post with a simple finish.

> 1-1

The first third finished up level and the second third went without a goal. A fair few Frothers corners though.

Going back into the wind in the third allowed the Frothers to find their rhythm again. **Yash** managed to find the defence over-committed and was able to bridge the last man and finish under the keeper for his second.

> 2-1

**Salty** was found on the edge of the box and managed to chip the ball over the keeper to extend the lead.

> 3-1

In a late flash of brilliance, **Farshid** received the ball in the middle of the park and let fly a stinger that the keeper could only parry into his own net.

> 4-1

## Man of the match

Some good performances out there for the first game of the season. Salty and Yash get the joint award for some hard work and key goals.

## Dick of the day

Farshid that you, baby?

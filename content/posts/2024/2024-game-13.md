A mid-season friendly against the team taking div 2 by storm, Lazy XI.

The positions were mixed up to give the boys a chance to show off their repertoire.![](/pace-front-line.jpg)

## First Half

The boys were all eagerness and little organisation for the first 30 minutes. Feeling that scoreboard pressure with only a few of the boys having not having picked up a goal this season yet.

The closest chance of the first half came when Ryan hit a first time shot from a squared ball, but it went narrowly wide.

## Second Half

Lance got the whistle and Charles showed up for some beer. Doube and Jacob swapped gloves.

Lazy XI struck first in the second half, finding a defensive overload.

> 0-1

The Frothers almost hit back immediately with a good run and cross from Jacob. Farshid reached the ball at the moment it reached the back post, awkwardly.

His moment would come.

Farshid won a free kick in the attacking half, after taking a big shoulder. Evan delivered the perfect ball in, and Farshid was there to finish it.

> 1-1

It was almost the Farsh show from there. An almost assist as a deep through ball put Yash in.

In the last minute it was almost the late show and spinning in the box, Farshid was brought down. Evan was reffing and having none of it. Blowing the final whistle.

## Man of the Match

A solid showing from our two stand-in CBs Jamie and Evan. Jamie gets it for bringing up his 50 Caps.

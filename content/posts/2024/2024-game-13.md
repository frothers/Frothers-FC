A mid-season friendly against the team taking div 2 by storm, Lazy XI.

The positions were mixed up to give the boys a chance to show off their repertoire.![](/pace-front-line.jpg)

## First Half

The boys were all eagerness and little organisation for the first 30 minutes. Feeling that scoreboard pressure with only a few of the boys having not having picked up a goal this season yet.

The closest chance of the first half came when Ryan hit a first time shot from a squared ball, but it went narrowly wide.

## Second Half

Lance got the whistle and Charles showed up for some beer. Doube and Jacob swapped gloves.

Lazy XI struck first in the second half, finding a defensive overload.

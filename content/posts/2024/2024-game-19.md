The froth is back

After a few weeks of commuting to Naenae and being rained off, we were back to prime football conditions. Sunny day, light wind, artificial.

## Kickoff

The boys were trying a 5-3-2 formation due to the abundance of defenders in the side. The boys weren't quite playing Frothers' flowing football, but that was not to be a barrier to getting goals.

The Frothers opened the scoring through a set-piece. **Yarride** crossed a corner into the near post, on the second attempt, for **Chris** to nod home.

> 1-0

The Frothers weathered a bit more pressure throughout the half, with the opposition resorting to long range shots. Complaining that the new official match balls were not up to scratch showed the level of desperation the back 5 was leading them to.

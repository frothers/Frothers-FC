The froth is back

After a few weeks of commuting to Naenae and being rained off, we were back to prime football conditions. Sunny day, light wind, artificial. The game also marked 100 games for **Milan**.

## Kickoff

The boys were trying a 5-3-2 formation due to the abundance of defenders in the side. The boys weren't quite playing Frothers' flowing football, but that was not to be a barrier to getting goals.

The Frothers opened the scoring through a set-piece. **Yarride** crossed a corner into the near post, on the second attempt, for **Chris** to nod home.

> 1-0

The Frothers weathered a bit more pressure throughout the half, with the opposition resorting to long range shots. Complaining that the new official match balls were not up to scratch showed the level of desperation the back 5 was leading them to.

Farshid, ever a man of the people, tried to cause a rift for the Laxy XI attackers by doing his best double movements studs up challenge from the ground. The ref in an act of sympathy allowed for a yellow, a substitution, and a get-out-of-jail-free card to be all the punishment dolled out.

**Jacob**, freshly on for **Farshid**, decided that international borders and football positions are man made constructs. Setting off from RCB to end up in the left winger position, he sent a low cross in that **Lance** dummied over, and **Jordan** finished.

> 2-0

The Frothers weren't done yet, a ball over the top from centurian, **Milan**, found **Yash** who sqaured it up for **Jordan**. Beating his man, he found the bottom corner of the net for his second.

> 3-0

## Halftime

Though 3-0 up, the boys weren't particularly happy with their performance. **Yarride** was channeling Klopp, with the gerning and everything.

After twenty odd minutes Laxy XI finally hit back through a cut in and a deflected shot from the left winger.

> 3-1

In the dying stages Laxy XI were getting deperate, and managed to cash in their brownie point with the ref. Crashing through **Ryan**, the Laxy XI striker couldn't believe his luck when the whistle was for a goal, rather than the punishment for a flagrant foul.

> 3-2

Thats all she wrote, and the Frothers are through to another Plate final against Koffis.

## Man of the match

In a match of not a lot of flow, doing the basics right was key. **Doube** put in a great shift, locking down his side of defence, and making the opposition resort to the dark arts.

## Dick of the day

Few nominations, **Patrick C** off a couple times like his controller had disconnected, **Farshid** risking it all to make sure **Lance** knows who is getting the grub award this season.
**Yarride** picks it up for turning on the boys, however.

### 100 games for Milan

Reliable and selfless, won't even score a pen as he is worried it will go to his head.

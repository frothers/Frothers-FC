Back to a regular season game with both the **Rosario** brothers. Family Time.

Like all good movie scripts, the later instalments all begin with tragedy. Losing the runner through the middle, the Frothers went behind as a chipped through ball put the Pelicans' striker in.

> 0-1

A no-name extra had wrecked his ride in the corner, and the Frothers had to check their lines to avoid being disqualified. **Yash** managed this expertly. First breaking through himself to score and then doing it again, but finding his bother, **Yarride.**

> **FAMILY**

> 2-1

Knowing it isn't about how you start, but how you finish (the first half) the Frothers put the NOS on. Yash putting another 2 past the Pelicans.

> 4-1

## Halftime

Classic family mealtime to set the scene for the finale![](/boysathalf.jpg)

The Pelicans came out and contested the game a lot more in the second half.

The Frothers were struggling to make any play stick, a classic Loss and Regrowth story arc.

Pelicans managed to pull one back through a deep free kick. There was a potential sleeper agent in the mix as a Frothers player headed the ball perfectly back into his own 6 yard box. **Ryan** tipped it onto the bar for a Pelicans player to follow-up.

> 5-2

The Frothers needed this to kick-start their game, **Evan H** ran onto a through-ball and was brought down by their keeper.

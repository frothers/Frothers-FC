Back to a regular season game with both the **Rosario** brothers. Family Time.

Like all good movie scripts, the later instalments all begin with tragedy. Losing the runner through the middle, the Frothers went behind as a chipped through ball put the Pelicans' striker in.

> 0-1

A no-name extra had wrecked his ride in the corner, and the Frothers had to check their lines to avoid being disqualified. **Yash** managed this expertly. First breaking through himself to score and then doing it again, but finding his bother, **Yarride.**

> **FAMILY**

> 2-1

Knowing it isn't about how you start, but how you finish (the first half) the Frothers put the NOS on. **Yash** putting another 2 past the Pelicans.

> 4-1

## Halftime

Classic family mealtime to set the scene for the finale![](/boysathalf.jpg)

The Pelicans came out and contested the game a lot more in the second half.

The Frothers were struggling to make any play stick, a classic Loss and Regrowth story arc.

Pelicans managed to pull one back through a deep free kick. There was a potential sleeper agent in the mix as a Frothers player headed the ball perfectly back into his own 6 yard box. **Ryan** tipped it onto the bar for a Pelicans player to follow-up.

> 5-2

The Frothers needed this to kick-start their game, **Evan H** ran onto a through-ball and was brought down.
It was time for some redemption for **Ryan**. Running the whole pitch to take the spot kick. **Yarride** must have been on the bench, just like Vin in Tokyo Drift. The penalty was straight and high, but thankfully still below the bar this time.

> 6-2

Next time it was **Yarride** who went one-on-one with the keeper. A chip shot over the keeper had just enough on it to seal the deal. **Yarride** then dropped a top 10 respect highlight reel moment with the keeper.

> 7-2

A late bit of drama and controversy as the Frothers were through on goal and the keeper brought down the man on goal. The ball dropped for **Jamie**, but he missed the empty goal.

## Man of the Match

With two hat tricks it is hard to pick, but **Yash** broke the game open early and provided assists to his brother at the same time.

## Dick of the Day

Through the scoreline was a blow-out in the end, there were quite a few potential villains. **Farshid**, always a mercurial figure, played a beautiful goal making header for the opposition. **Ryan** made sure we were kept in the shit books with the ref by chirping at him with every decision, demanding a foul for their goal and calling for the blood of their third choice keeper in the late stages of the game.

**Jamie B** picks it up this week for watching too much rugby and just wanting to run it straight into the first player he saw every time he got the ball. This combined with the open goal miss was an uncharacteristic showing from the Gizzy boy. Don't worry, the boys sorted him out.

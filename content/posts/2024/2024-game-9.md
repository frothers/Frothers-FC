Derby day, and a big day for **Ryan** who was looking at racking up 100 caps in record time. He got to wear the armband out for a frantic 90 minutes.

Another high scoring game with plenty of drama for the large supporter turn out for the Frothers. Trying to replicate the plot armour Madrid showed in the Champions league final earlier that day the Frothers were out to keep pressure on the top of the league.

## First Half
Rolling straight onto the pitch following the previous match the boys were suffering from not having the ball walloped at them for 10 minutes as warm-up. **Ian Carvajal** falling victim to a strong pass which allowed the Mark Ave player to get a good shot off to **Ryan Cortois'** left. Coming up on a calendar year since a cleansheet...

> 0-1

The boys fought back straight away, finding a lot of joy on the wings, **Rosario Jr** had a shot spilled into the path of **Salty Joselu** who finished well.

> 1-1

Getting the taste of it, the boys were rabid for more goals. **Jude Bunting** moved up top and started to cook. **Lancerigo** got through on goal and his parried shot was put away by the false nine.

> 2-1

In keeping with the other goals, this goal also got a peice of the keeper in the build-up. This time some great chasing of an overhit ball over the top was done by **Lancerigo** resulted in the keeper spilling it under the pressure. **Lance** was able to escape the challenge and sqaure for **Buntingham** to double his tally.

> 3-1

The boys had the fire and **Lance** was on the end of this one. **Yash** cut back the ball for the boys to really put the nuts in.

> 4-1

In a desperate move, Mark Ave put **Sule** up top to harass the Frothers backline. Not long after he was put through on goal by a good through-ball. **Ryan** took that personally, and on his 100th game decided it was time to continue to proud Frother tradition of getting a red card for a handball. Coming out of the box, a great diving save stopped Mark Ave closing the lead, for the moment at least.Unlike Madrid, the ref was more than happy to punish the Frothers.

**Doube** took up the gloves, and immediate got his cleansheet ruined from the following freekick.

> 4-2

## Halftime

**Yaride Ancelotti** was in his element figuring out how we would see the game out with 10. Stacking the midfield to stiffle play.

The second half had the potential to be seriously challenging, and when the first goal was scored was going to be all important. Stepping up yet again for the Frothers, Mr Reliable **Lance** was played in by **Jamie**. Driving at goal the toe was put to great us to extend the lead to 3 again.

> 5-2

After a half of longballs, which the Frothers valliently repelled, Mark Ave overcommitted on an attack. Two clearances led to **Yarride Torres** rounding the keeper to seal the games.

> 6-2

## Man of the Match
Lots of options for this. Up top both **Lance** and **Bunting** had huge games in terms of goals and assists. Lots of running in the midfield with everyone putting in a shift. **Lance** picks it up this week as he was there when we needed him most.

## Dick of the Day
Again, a couple of options. Realistically no-one is going to take it away from **Ryan** for getting sent off in his 100th game while we were 3 goals up. **Yarride** gets a nod for sneaking on to get a cap once the game what put to bed. He also tried to make a mid-play substitution of a CB which somehow didn't result in a goal.

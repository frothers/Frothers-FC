# Game 2 - League

Back at Wellington College for a slick, windy midday kick off with a little rain, everything felt right.

Trialing a slight change in formation with the 3-4-1-2, with a couple of debuts too.

**Farshid** started at the left wing back role and was a thorn in the side of the opposition from the first minute. The Frother's reigning grub looked so comfortable and intuative that many in the crowd were questioning if this was an elaborate doppleganger. Analysts have identified a strong correlation between the presence of **Salty,** and Farshid masterclasses.

The first goal was off the back of some truely filthy play from the man himself. A couple ball rolls, a nutmeg, and a drive to the byline led to a spilled ball i nthe box which **Evan H** bundled home.

> 1-0

The boys had a few more hopeful shots throught the half, but nothing more was coming.

## Halftime

I managed to pop away for a couple of seconds at the start of the second half and naturally the boys were back to level.

> 1-1

This was a good test, however, as the Frothers were controlling the game and should be able to back themselves to get another goal or two.

It was the other wing back, Hugo, how got the boys cooking again. Showing relentless energy and good decision-making down the wing, he was a constant threat and kept the boys on the front foot. A few corners were swung into dangerous positions, but without any of the tall timber in the team today, there were question marks about whether the boys could convert. The doubters would be proven wrong, and a leap showing off all the cartilage of a lad in their 20s elevated Hugo above the crowd to nod home the corner.

> 2-1

It wouldn't be a Frothers game without a Yarride goal, a beautiful sweeping Frothers move found Yarride on the right wing. Seeing the keeper off his line he expertly lofted over a chip from near the corner of the 18 yard box, falling perfectly into the top bins.

Yarride must have history with the Ring-ins team, as he showed a sign of respect by not celebrating.

Some late controversy, as a pretty stonewall penalty was ignored against Evan, only for a soft freekick to be given just outside the box at the other end bare moments later.

## Man of the Match

Both wing backs had great games, but I'm giving it to Hugo. Tireless all match, and breaking the deadlock when the Frothers really needed a goal to secure the game. Love a header off a corner.

## Dick of the Day

Has to be Yarride for scoring the dirtiest shank finish. It was topped off by the curse and half walk away after catching it square on the heel.

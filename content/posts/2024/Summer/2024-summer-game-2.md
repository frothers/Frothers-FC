# Game 2 - League

Back at Wellington College for a slick, windy midday kick off with a little rain, everything felt right.

Trialing a slight change in formation with the 3-4-1-2, with a couple of debuts too.

**Farshid** started at the left wing back role and was a thorn in the side of the opposition from the first minute. The Frother's reigning grub looked so comfortable and intuative that many in the crowd were questioning if this was an elaborate doppleganger. Analysts have identified a strong correlation between the presence of **Salty,** and Farshid masterclasses.

The first goal was off the back of some truely filthy play from the man himself. A couple ball rolls, a nutmeg, and a drive to the byline led to a spilled ball i nthe box which **Evan H** bundled home.

# Game 3 - League

Third game of the season on a lovely day at Wakefield.
[Veo Match Video](https://app.veo.co/matches/20241020-match-20-oct-2024-b40dfffa/#t=51:09)

Flying into the game, it wasn't long before disaster struck. **Yash Rosario** rushed in to compete for a weak back pass to the keeper and fell awkwardly. 45 minutes, an ambulance, and more than 100 rips later and **Yash** was off to hospital.

## Kick-off 2
A new 60 minute match started off. Cobham drive appeared to have found inspiration from the delay as they came out of the blocks hot. Cutting inside they scored from a well placed shot from outside the box
> 0-1

Not long after, **Aleksey** got the ball on the edge of the box and managed to loft the ball over the top of the keeper for his first Frothers goal.

> 1-1

Not long after the Cobham drive boys got a bit cute with it at the back and **Evan H** fell on the ball on the edge of the box. Finishing with aplomb into the corner with his left.

> 2-1

Cobham hit back straight away, with some quick control in the box after a quick ball forwards.

> 2-2

## Halftime

A rapidfire first half was followed up by an equally frantic second-half.

Cobham scored first as a low cross was parried straight to the striker who could tap it home.

> 2-3

Again, it was a rapid response. **Farshid** did some great work on the wing, bringing it inside and then releasing **Aleksey** who was again able to loft it over the keeper.

> 3-3

Cobham again took the lead through some good following up off a hopeful shot from the edge of the box.

> 3-4

It wasn't 30s before the Frothers were level again, however. From the Kickoff **Chris** launched a hopeful ball at the backline. Taking an age to bring it under, **Yarride** was able to pick the defender's pocket. He then lifted it over the defender and slot it home.

> 4-4


## Man of the Match
Never has one man pulled in so much beer money in one match to the Frother's coffers. Even on **Farshid's** most homicidal outings. **Yash** boldly fell on his sword to get the boys some beers on Better Football.


## Dick of the Day
Though we typically don't award the award for poor play, fluffing the ball on the line to miss out on your hattrick has got **Aleksey** his first DotD.

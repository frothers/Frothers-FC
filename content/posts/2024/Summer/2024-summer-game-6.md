# Game 6 - League

The Frothers back with the goods.

At the ripe time of 9am the Frothers were back at Wakefield.

Playing the hot stepping Farshid up top, the Frothers took a little while to get firing, but it was inevitable that the man was going to score. Latching onto a half volley **Farsh** drilled the ball home.

> 1-0

He was then off to the sideline to let **Yarride** take back his natural position. Not wanting to be outdone, **Yarride** turned a low cross from Hugo into the net some minutes later.

> 2-0

The third goal also came from a ball going square. This time directly from a throw in that bounced through for **Dylan** to latch onto to get his first Frothers goal.

> 3-0

## Halftime 

The boys were feeling like they had their youthful energy back as they went into the second half. 

The Frothers extended their lead even further as yet another square ball from Evan found **Aleksey** who volleyed it first time into the bottom corner

> 4-0

It was then the return of our old friend, own goal.

> 5-0


They managed to hit back with a late goal, a lofted cross from deep was headed in to ease the heartache. 

> 5-1

## MoTM
Some great performances and good goals Including **Dylan** with his first Frothers goal. But it goes to **Evan Hansen** put in an absolute shift, rolling back the years to cover the pitch.

## DoTD
Again some good prospects, **Yarride** deliberately kicked the ball over the fence, claiming he was going for a throw in..
**Lance** gets it, however , for bringing himself on as CB and we conceded almost immediately after. He also got fully sat down at one stage.

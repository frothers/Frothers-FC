> We'll track back mañana

Coming into the business end of the season and the Frothers need to keep their winning ways to be in with a shout for the trophy.

The first half showed the Frothers keeping up the assault from last week. A lot of chances, and some questionable shot selection.

**Yarride** broke the deadlock with a snapshot down to the keepers side.

> 1-0

A memoriam on chip shots had to be rolled out as the boys thought that it was them who had Ángel Di María as their uncle.

## Halftime

If the boys thought there were some goals on offer in the first half they were going to lose their mind in the second.

They had to deal with a test of their resolve first, as the half latino Frother **Charles Daily** got called out for a definite accident of a handball

Not to fear, as **Ryan** has been itching for a bit of penalty practice. 80% of the time they go to the keepers left, everytime.

After that little scare the Frothers had about 100 changes, from dragging it wide to passing it to ghosts for tap-ins, something had to give.


A Latinos player channelled his innermost Saurez to give the Frothers a chance at a penalty.

**Yarride** stepped up and looked to compensate for the wind. But pushed it wide.

Luckily, a few minutes later a latinos player decided to try play the offside trap from 10 metres outside of his half. **Yarride** put his foot down and scored with pure force of will.

> 2-0

A free kick was then given about 40 out. Fancying his ability to whip in a killer ball, **Milan** stepped up and his one right off his ankle to **Oli**, who managed to find himself some space in the box and put one in off the toe.

> 3-0

The Latinos defence was non-existant from then on, and the Frothers were trying their hardest to squander chances.

## Man of the Match
**Ryan** was in with a good shot of doing back-to-back MotM, however in the following game he gave away and saved a penalty just for fun. So this is just BAU now.

**Milan** actually picks it up this week for a cleansheet + assist combo.

## Dick of the Day
Oh boy there were a few options here. Though a commanding game, the boys were really doing it the hard way. **Ian** gets a special mention for not only ruining his own scoring opportunities in the box, but also getting **Jake's** goal ruled out by getting in the way of the shot while offside.

Remembering that dick of the day is about doing dumb shit, rather than playing poo, there was really no other option. Personifying this was **Oli**. Practically through 1-on-1 **Oli** attempted a square ball to thin air. Tried a quick free pick from 30m out, again to the wind. The worst has to be the goal, however. Turning an absolute shank of a delivery from **Milan** into a goal through use of the toe is almost unforgivable.

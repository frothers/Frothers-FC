> We'll track back mañana

Coming into the business end of the season and the Frothers need to keep their winning ways to be in with a shout for the trophy.

The first half showed the Frothers keeping up the assault from last week. A lot of chances, and some questionable shot selection.

**Yarride** broke the deadlock with a snapshot down to the keepers side.

> 1-0

A memoriam on chip shots had to be rolled out as the boys thought that it was them who had Ángel Di María as their uncle.

## Halftime

If the boys thought there were some goals on offer in the first half they were going to lose their mind in the second.

They had to deal with a test of their resolve first, as the half latino Frother **Charles Daily** got called out for a definite accident of a handball

Not to fear, as **Ryan** has been itching for a bit of penalty practice. 80% of the time they go to the keepers left, everytime.

After that little scare the Frothers had about 100 changes, from dragging it wide to passing it to ghosts for tap-ins, something had to give.

A Latinos player channelled his innermost Saurez to give the Frothers a chance at a penalty.

**Yarride** stepped up and looked to compensate for the wind. But pushed it wide.

Luckily, a few minutes later a latinos player decided to try play the offside trap from 10 metres outside of his half. **Yarride** put his foot down and scored with pure force of will.

> 2-0

A free kick was then given about 40 out. **Fancying** his ability to whip in a killer ball **Milan**, stepped up and his one right off his ankle to **Oli**, who managed to find himself some space in the box and put one in off the toe.

> 3-0

The Latinos defence was non-existant from then on, and the Frothers were trying their hardest to squander chances.

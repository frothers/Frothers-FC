## Summer league match 11

On a sunny Wellington afternoon, Frothers FC, resplendent in their signature purple, faced off against Lazy Sunday, decked out in green and apparently assembling a dream team of Cap 1 mercenaries. The day began with a classic Frothers scramble—starting with only five confirmed
players just hours before kickoff—but miraculously, three subs appeared as if conjured by divine intervention.

## First Half

The game kicked off with both teams evenly matched, trading blows like a heavyweight boxing bout. Frothers fought valiantly, holding their own despite Lazy Sunday's suspiciously stacked lineup. The first half was a showcase of tight defense and missed opportunities on both ends.

But then, calamity struck. A minor misstep in Frothers' defense gave Lazy Sunday the opening they needed. With clinical precision, they slotted one past **Ryan**, breaking the deadlock and deflating Frothers' spirits like a flat beach ball.

> 0-1

## Second Half

Determined to turn things around, **Farshid** unleashed his inner master tactician at halftime. He nagged **Yarride** into putting him up front, declaring himself the human shield that would stop Frothers from scoring.

The strategy lasted all of five minutes before **Dylan** delivered a jaw-dropping cross straight to **Dylan Ringin (Stable)**. The chemistry between the **Dylans** was undeniable, and the latter tapped it in with the ease of ordering a Sunday brunch.

> 1-1.

Lazy Sunday, undeterred, pushed hard for a winner. Their relentless pressure paid off during a corner kick. A lofted cross to the far post found an unmarked player who nodded the ball in for a 2-1 lead. Frothers were left collectively questioning why marking on corners was suddenly
optional.

> 1-2

Frothers did their best to claw back into the game, with several near misses and valiant efforts, but ultimately, the result remained 2-1. The silver lining? Frothers proudly secured their spot in Division 2 with no risk of promotion—exactly as planned, right? "Play great, come third" is the quote of the day.

## Motm

**Dylan**, for his midfield dominance and a Di María-esque assist that was so good it could make a grown man weep.

## Dotd

**Farshid**, because it’s been a while, and sometimes you just need to remind everyone who the reigning champion of DOTD is.

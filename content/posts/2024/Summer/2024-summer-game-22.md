The title decider. It all came down to this, if the Frothers could get anything from the match they would be division champions. 

The opposition defaulted.

So we got a bonus game against a lower league opposition. And the stats count

The boys were doing it the hard way, however. **Oli** managed to grab a goal in the first half, with a **Ryan** assist, who was playing up top.

> 1-0

**Chris** was playing in goal in the first half and was determined not to be outdone by a cheeky low shot. Probably should have been concentrating more on the ball in the air, as a lofted shot snuck right through the mitts.

> 1-1

## Halftime

The frontline experiment of **Farshid** and **Ryan**, though industrious, needed a shake up. **Farshid** was put between the sticks, and **Yarride** finally came off the bench to go up top.

It took a matter of minutes until a **Yarride** shot was poached off the line by **Ryan** to get his first outfield goal.

> 2-1

**Oli** was next up with a bonafide putt from outside the box.

> 3-1

**Hugo** followed this up with a great hit into the top bins to get the Frothers right in controll.

> 4-1

With goals on offer **Yarride** wouldn't be too far away. **Charles** went on a run up the wing and managed to find **Yarride** with a square ball. Desperate to get out of the way of the shot, **Ryan** went flying to the ground.

> 5-1

And he got another 

> 6-1

Finally breaking the duck egg, everyone's favourite baby boy managed to claim a goal from a goal-line scramble.

> 7-1

## Man of the Match


## Dick of the Day
In a no-win situation in the backline **James** was up against a 14 year old. Don't hurt him and don't get sat down by him. Well at least he didn't hurt him.

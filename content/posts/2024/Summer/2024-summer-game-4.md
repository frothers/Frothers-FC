# Game 1 - Plate

First proper game of the knockout games and the Frothers were up against the 4th division Buds.

An unbelievably windy day at St Pats meant that any thoughts of flowing football were out the window, and the aim of the game was to grind out a result.

Much deliberation was made about what way to attack first, and with the wind was chosen to hopefully avoid the possibility of a freak goal against the run the play. That went about as well as you would expect with **Evan H** casually letting one run under his foot for the striker to jump onto.

> 0-1

It was time to bring on the man who loves a goal contribution, **Aleksey**. With his first touches of the ball he managed to find **Lance** in the middle of the box, who was able to bring it down and pick his spot

> 1-1

## Halftime

Not in the ideal position, but hopeful that a headwind would actually make for better football the Frothers kicked off the second half.

We did create more clear cut opportunities, but it took a bit of doggedness from **Yarride** to break the deadlock. A bit of shoulder to shoulder contest followed up by a trademark breakaway and slotted finish.

> 2-1

Two more clear opportunities came the Frothers' way, another to **Yarride**, who could only find the keeper. The second to **Ian** to blazed one against the post.

## Man of the Match
Bringing up 100 goals for the Frothers, it has to be **Yarride**. 


## Dick of the Day
For getting a free game and then trying to avoid being subbed after being on the pitch for 70 minutes, it goes to fair weather Frother, **Charles**.

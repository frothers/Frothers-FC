# Game 5 - League

Back at Wakefield on a great 4 seasons type of day in the capital.

The first half was plagued by rain, making for a slick pitch. A few decent attacks, with the closest chance falling to **Yarride** who connected too sweetly with a volley outside the box to miss the target with the keeper stranded.

The game had somehow managed to stay level at the break

# Game 5 - League

Back at Wakefield on a great 4 seasons type of day in the capital.

The first half was plagued by rain, making for a slick pitch. A few decent attacks, with the closest chance falling to **Yarride** who connected too sweetly with a volley outside the box to miss the target with the keeper stranded.

## Halftime

The game had somehow managed to stay level at the break, the Frothers weren't panicking though. Something had to give

It wasn't long until it did, **Aleksey** played a through ball that **Yarride** happily chased and poked round the keeper

> 1-0

That was enough to turn the game in the Frothers favour. A freekick on the edge of the box for BNU came to be their undoing as they tried to get a bit tricky with it and ended up needing their keeper to deal with it from near halfway. He didn't. **Aleksey** was able to race away with it for the Frother's second.

> 2-0

It was all Frothers from there on in. **Lance** managed to steal in for a goal, again from an **Aleksey** assist. Dropping a big Sui to make sure they know we are dicks.

> 3-0

Getting a bit cute with it, BNU tried to play out the high press. They could only find, **Ian** however. Playing **Aleksey** in for his second.

> 4-0

## Man of the Match
Getting shafted with the DotD last time he scored two, **Aleksey** picks it up this week for 2 goals and 2 assist. Plus getting the boys a lot of time in front of the camera, even if a few of us are better seen from a distance.

## Dick of the day
A few options for this one. **Milan** made a good case for himself when, with no opposition player with 30m, he dropped a clanger of a foul throw. **Patrick Moore** also managed to pick up a yellow for a filthy challenge in the last minute of the game to keep our professional image going.
The award this week goes to **Evan H** who managed to forget his boots and had to Uber to grab them, missing the start of the match.

Back playing Summerdeez, and the rivalry continues.

The first-half was pretty cagey, with the main points of note being a good strong 1-on-1 save by Ryan on a player that managed to break 3 tackles to end up face to face with the thick between the sticks.

The best chance of the half for the Frothers came from an Evan H square ball to Yarride who couldn't quick get his foot around it. Oli also narrowly blazed over a couple from outside the box.

## Halftime

The second-half saw some more goal action. The first goal coming the way of Summerdeez. A rebounded cross off Chris came back to the crosser who managed to first-time curl one over Ryan, couldn't do it again if he tried.

> 0-1

Not long after, a clever use of the offside trap gave the Frothers' a freekick within their half. Chris managed to loft one over the backline for Evan H to run onto and finish with aplomb.

> 1-1

## Player of the Match

Put a shift in and made it so I didn't need to run so much after an extended holiday. That's a MoTM to me. James.

## Dick of the Day

Kicking the ball away after conceding a needless freekick? Patrick Moore, you grub.

## Summer league match 10

Frothers were back again for their latest kick off to date, a graveyard shift of 8:15pm for which some of the boys were already wrapped up, dreaming of calm skies and midday kick offs.

The rest of us were risking it all to taste the Froth while we can, because the Glass man comes for us all…

The game kicked off with neither team really able to control play and link together any good passages of play.

It wasn't long before disaster struck. Not registering that warming up properly was going to be essential on a cold night, your baby boy, **Chris**, managed to do a hammy on a footrace. A relatively simple cleanup job turned into a full blown breakaway. Harimau showed no hesitation to take advantage and take the lead.

> 0-1

**Yarride**, who was hoping to just steal another appearance , was now playing at CB for 70 mins.

The Frothers got the opportunity to level things up from the spot. A controversial decision was awarded when **Aleksey** was attempted to be boxed out by the opposite defender who was nowhere near the ball….

**Dylan** stepped up and drilled the penalty to level things up.

> 1-1

Not long after, **Farshid** made a break into the box again. Letting the ball get away from him **Shand** capitalised and slapped a shot to make it two.

## Halftime

The Frothers were well in control going into halftime.

In a bizarre series of events a backpass was picked up in the Frother’s box. The resulting free kick was rolled out and a lofted shot dropped into the back post.

> 2-2

Harimau weren't done, they came back again and a hard running drive to the line resulted in them taking the lead.

> 2-3

It was time for the Frothers to put the foot down, **Dylan** picked the ball up in his own half and left multiple players in his wake as he went to goal. Delivering a ball that was too good to not score, OG took over the defender's body and sent the ball screaming into the back of the net.

> 3-3

The boys weren't done, a late corner from **Shand** found the front post run of **Farshid**. A good header put the Frothers in the lead.

## Motm

Man of the match today was **Dylan** with a goal, assist, and was able to keep his composure in the wind.

## Dotd

A combination of picking up a no pressure backpass and then conceding from the resulting freekick is enough for **Ryan** to pick up the award. It wasn't helped by the quote of "I wasn't watching who kicked it".

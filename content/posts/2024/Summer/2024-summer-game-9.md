## Summer league match 9

The Frothers were in a dangerous spot, within automatic promotion to a competitive first division. 

It was the perfect time to come up against the top of the table. With goal difference to burn the Frothers just needed to let the bookies take an early bath. 

The boys went above and beyond, the boys let 6 whoopsies go in.

## Motm
The Frothers rule is you keep what you bring,and **Pratik's** Ring-in **Daniel** brought great energy to a depleted Frothers squad. **Pratik** himself also set me up with a corner that was too good to score, so double kudos.

## Dotd
a reprieve this week

Two games to go and the Frothers were in poll position. A game in hand on their closest rivals, Cobham Drive, and a match up against an old adversary in Mark Ave.

An interesting 4-1-5 formation meant that the first attack my Mark Ave resulted in a counter leading to the Frother's first goal. A shot by **Yarride** that the keeper wasn't really interested in.

> 1-0

**Mark Ave** again pressed forwards with dangerous looking attacks, but again overcommitted. **Oli** was able to another past the keeper to give the Frothers a two goal lead.

> 2-0

The next attack was started by a beautiful shinner from **Farshid** to start some havoc in the midfield. **Yarride** found himself with the ball on the edge of the box and decided that testing the keeper was worth a gamble. The poor keeper must have been an outfielder, as we was completely wrong footed and the shot went right in.

> 3-0

The Frothers were soon to feel the joys of fill-in goal keeping duties as **Ryan** saw a shot late and only had enough time to get his hands halfway up. One dislocated finger later and it was time for the Frothers to see who wanted to deputise. The boys were claiming their value to the team, begging, or straight up vacating the area.

One man stepped up to the task. **Farshid** donned the gloves for the remaining hour.

**Farshid's** first test came shortly after

> 3-1

In retrospect, I'm surprised it wasn't more like this. Love you Farsh.

The boys managed to manufacture a corner. **Yarride** decided to listen to the inner voices and try it on. I'm never getting a delivery to the penalty spot again.

> 4-1

## Halftime
The boys were down to no subs. Luckily **Hugo** did some fast recruitment on the sideline and we got **LeBron** to give us a breather.

A 3 goal cushion would be enough for some teams to feel comfortable, not the Frothers. The second half master class of parking the bus.

There were still attacking opportunities, however. A great cross from **Oli** found **Lance** in the box who was dragged down by a lagging defender,

**Lance** stepped up and slotted the penalty.

> 5-1

Was a 4 goal lead enough for the Frothers to take the foot off their defensive obligations?

## Man of the Match
**Farshid** almost had this on lock. Until he managed to rip **Ryan's** gloves. Hard to beat a hattrick in a must win game. **Yarride** comes back into the glory of MotM.

## Dick of the Day
They say that birthdays don't mean as much when you get older, and nowhere is that more than the **Frothers**. Celebrating 21 years is supposedly not enough to justify you telling the boys to use their fucking brains.

Two games to go and the Frothers were in poll position. A game in hand on their closest rivals, Cobham Drive, and a match up against an old adversary in Mark Ave.

An interesting 4-1-5 formation meant that the first attack my Mark Ave resulted in a counter leading to the Frother's first goal. A shot by **Yarride** that the keeper wasn't really interested in.

> 1-0

The Festive season is upon us and the Frothers were in a giving mood on a sunny afternoon at Wakefield Park. With all sorts of permutations being discussed before hand, the team talk centred around one key strategy - don’t win big. 

Play well. Come third.

Nobody thought it would be a problem after all the defenders decided to take an early holiday and **Yarride** found himself lost at the South Pole, thankfully supported by 2 of the nicest elves going round, **Doube** and **Ian**. **Aleksey** called in some help from **Brad** the Easter Bunny, but with no subs available compared to the stack Summer Blaze had under the tree it felt like a long afternoon was coming.  

After a 10 minute delay to start while they sorted a ref, it was a quiet start to the game in windy conditions. Frothers were dominating possession without creating too many chances but it was only a matter of time until their strike force came to life. **Lance *Santa* Molyneaux** and **Aleksey *Rudolph* Vakhroushev** are creating a legendary connection up top that the fans will sing about for years to come and once that red nose was centred on goal, it was over for the Blazers. First, **Rudolph** finished from a very tight angle.

>1-0

Next Santa sleighed past 4 defenders on way to the bye line before cutting it back for the ***Easter Bunny*** to double the lead.

> 2-0

The **3 Wise Men** playing centre back were passing it around nicely and easily cutting out any counters as Frothers kept firm control of the game. A bit too controlled, with promotion looming, but when needing to concede you can always count on **Kevin *Farshid* MacCalister** to get up to his usual antics when left Home Alone in the box. A blatant push on an unsuspecting attacker and the ref had no choice but to point to the spot. However, in goal was **Ryan *the Grinch*** Who Stole Christmas, and possibly Division 2 safety, with another trademark penalty save and it remained 2-0.

Any time Frothers found themselves under attack **Dylan** and **Hanson** did their best ***John McClane** impersonation and wiped out all threat. The passing from back to front was a piece of art that nobody will have the good fortune of viewing as the league continue to refuse videoing games where the Frothers play well. Another attack that started from their own box, another assist for **Santa**, another goal for **Rudolph**. The dreaded big win and goal difference swing was starting to look likely.

With **Little Nia *Lou Who*** leaving cakes for the boys at halftime, the festive spirit intoxicated the lads and pushed them on to even Better Football in the second half. Sometimes the football is so nice, there’s just nothing you can do. Surely one of the other teams would win. 

Play well. Come third. 

Continuing to play out from the back at every opportunity and with the midfielders running golden rings around the Blazers it was only time before more goals were scored.

**Lance** got a well deserved spot on the scoresheet after some strong hustle play to win a loose ball in the box before setting up **Pratik the Frosty Snowman** to finish as cool as ice - though with a big deflection on the way. But OG wasn’t claiming this one as **Frosty** gets his first goal for the club. The best of the bunch came last. Some silky passing on the edge of the box and a fierce left footed shot into the far corner from **Santa** for his second. Blazers must have been on the naughty list as they couldn’t sniff a chance to score and the clean sheet, confirmed at final whistle, capped off a magical day for the Men in Purple. 

6-0. 6 of the very best. Liquid Football. 

And now it was time to wait for the promise of eternal salvation from Division One to arrive. Finally, late into the evening, the good news was spread and the Frothers could rejoice.

Play well. Come third. 

Then Liverpool beat Man City 2-0 to go 9 points clear at the top. Merry Christmas. 

## Player of the Match 
The whole team could have won it this week. The front pair were extraordinary. The midfielders put in an incredible shift to dominate play. The wingbacks ran all day without subs. The defenders controlled the ball and kept a clean sheet. And the keeper was very tidy with ball at feet as well as saving a penalty. But everybody knows who Christmas is all about and **Lance Santa Molyneaux** was giving out assists like candy canes before scoring a double himself.

## Dick of the Day
Could have been Lance again for the sheer number of skill moves rudely making the opposition look like reindeer in roller skates. Could have been **Chris Scrooge Chester** for missing his chance to claim a clean sheet. But on this big weekend of promotion/relegation in the league, it has to go to Cobham Drive. Where’s the integrity lads?

The Yash memorial fixture.

Up against Cobham Drive again after last time the game was a stunning 4-4 draw after an hour's delay for respecting the fallen.

Cobham showed why they were good for 4 goals last time out, putting big pressure on in the early stages with several mercurial players in the midfield making the boys' lives a nightmare in a 4-4-2.

The left-winger benefitted, with two 1-on-1 opportunities from incisive balls giving Cobham Drive a daunting lead at the break.

> 0-2

# Halftime

The boys weren't quite clicking and the midfield were being dragged all over the place, it was time for a change. Back to the summer fav 3-5-2

The Yash memorial fixture.

Up against Cobham Drive again after last time the game was a stunning 4-4 draw after an hour's delay for respecting the fallen.

Cobham showed why they were good for 4 goals last time out, putting big pressure on in the early stages with several mercurial players in the midfield making the boys' lives a nightmare in a 4-3-3.

The left-winger benefited, with two 1-on-1 opportunities from incisive balls giving Cobham Drive a daunting lead at the break.

> 0-2

# Halftime

The boys weren't quite clicking and the midfield were being dragged all over the place, it was time for a change. Back to the summer fav 3-5-2.

The boys came out of the gate the a fire in their belly. One one of the first plays **Evan** won possession back, fed **Lance** who would try play **Yarride** in with a through-ball.

**Yarride** did his best Steven Bradbury impression, waiting for the goalie and defender to collide so he could stroll in for the open goal.

> 1-2

Seemingly the next play the boys were back at it. **Lance** flew into a challenge on a player taking too much time with the ball at the back. He then played **Bono** in to tie the game up with a well placed toe poke into the corner.

> 2-2

The boys were back! Unlucky not to take the lead in the following few plays, where **Yarride** could only find the keeper and **Jordan** sent one over from close range.

There was one last opportunity. **Evan** was brought down just outside the box. **Oli** floated a ball in and out
jumping **Evan** and **Chris** was **Yarride**. A great downwards header secured the Frothers the 3 points and their first win of 2025 with the last kick of the ball!

> 3-2

## Man of the Match
Great to see **Yarride** back among the goals after getting lost in the wilderness of centre back for a few weeks. A contested last minute header to top it all off!

## Dick of the Day
**Lance** went in on the boys for not closing down the space fast enough in the first half and then doubled down that the midfield were lazy ungrateful losers who were lucky to share a pitch with him. Suuuui

# Game 1 - Cup

The first full length game of the summer season and it was straight into the cup games. The Frothers had been lured into the ~~Super League~~ Better Football competition through the promise of riches and glory, and not playing in Naenae. A flood of teams joined the Frothers in the Waka jump and early grading was needed to seperate the social from the not-so-social teams.

## New formation

The Frothers were using the opportunity to try out a new 3-4-2-1 formation, utilising the plethora of defensive talent as best as possible.

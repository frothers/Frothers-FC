# Game 1 - Cup

The first full length game of the summer season and it was straight into the cup games. The Frothers had been lured into the ~~Super League~~ Better Football competition through the promise of riches and glory, and not playing in Naenae. A flood of teams joined the Frothers in the Waka jump and early grading was needed to seperate the social from the not-so-social teams.

## New formation

The Frothers were using the opportunity to try out a new 3-4-2-1 formation, utilising the plethora of defensive talent as best as possible.

The game was very much a defender's paradice, mostly possesion within deep parts of the field and heavy work from the midfield.

**Farshid** still managed to pick up some bonus points for a great goal line save to keep the game 0-0.

## Halftime

Keeping the same formation the game progressed without too many more incidents. To penalties!

## Penalties

**Evan Hanson** hit his off the crossbar, giving me vietnam flashbacks to the 2020 final.

**Evan Doube** struck his on target, but a strong hand from the keeper resulted in the save.

**Milan** managed to get a peno to stick, even if the keeper managed to get a hand to it.

The Blazers managed to score all 4 of their penalties, some would say unwisely, to get them into the top cup competition.

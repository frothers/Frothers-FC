# Game 8 - Plate

Frothers FC 4 - 1 BNU Rebels

James x 2 

Lance (Farshid Assist)

Evan 




The Frothers headed back to where it started, Wellington College, on a stunning Wellington evening for a midweek game in the plate competition vs BNU Rebels.




From the off, the Frothers controlled the game and it didn’t take long for Farshid to draw a foul on the edge of the box with a dive that Tom Daly would have been proud of. The free kick went into the wall but James was there 12 yards out to calmly side foot it into the net to make it 1-0.




The Rebels couldn’t handle the Frotherball on display - a few minutes later another foul was drawn, this time just inside the Rebels’s half. James, with his magic boots on, spotted Evan at the back post who volleyed past the keeper to make it two.




The Frother tiki-taka football continued, but 15 minutes later, it was the Rebels with a free kick deep in Frother territory. Dylan, reading the taker’s mind, intercepted a short pass and released Yarride, waiting on the half way line, for a 1-on-1 with the keeper. The keeper, quick off his line, managed to close down Yarride before he could sort his feet and stuck it out for a throw. 




Frothers were good value for their two goal lead going into the break and it didn’t take long for the Froth to be back on display in the second half - Farshid released Lance down the left hand side with a ball that had enough backspin on it to leave a burn mark on the pitch. It held up nicely, Lance inevitably beat the defender and calmly slotted it under the keeper to make it 3-0.




The Frothers had the ball in the back of the BNU net once again, for Lance to be questionably ruled offside.




Shortly after, the Frothers drew yet again another foul halfway inside the BNU half. With a routine off the training ground, Pratik delivered to the back stick where Evan was waiting to nod the ball across the face of goal for Lance to sweep in. Yet again, Lance was flagged offside, with it turning out post game that David Coote was in charge of lines on VAR.







5 minutes later, the Rebels were at it again, fouling Lance, wide on the right side of the pitch. James, the man of the moment, stepped up to deliver another pearler. With Farshid making a decoy run at the back post, the ball managed to go all the way through and slid past the keeper to make it four.




In a rare venture forwards, the Rebels beat the offside trap with a looping ball over the top for them to put the ball across the face of goal and tap in at the back post to make it 4-1.




This lit a fire inside the BNU bellies, who with 10 to go viciously took out the Frother engine room, Evan, with a shot to the nads from a couple of yards. Leaving him writhing in pain, the attacker fled the scene. Crime Stoppers NZ are asking for anybody with information regarding the assailant to please come forward.




MOTM & DOTD

The Frothers were Frothing for the 90, but two stand out performances taking the awards, having shone from dead ball situations for very different reasons. James taking MOTM for his two goals and assist and Evan taking DOTD for taking the absolute missile to the nuts.

# Game 8 - Plate

The Frothers headed back to where it started, Wellington College, on a stunning Wellington evening for a midweek game in the plate competition vs BNU Rebels.

From the off, the Frothers controlled the game and it didn’t take long for **Farshid** to draw a foul on the edge of the box with a dive that Tom Daly would have been proud of. The free kick went into the wall but **James** was there 12 yards out to calmly side foot it into the net to make it 1-0.

> 1-0

The Rebels couldn’t handle the Frotherball on display - a few minutes later another foul was drawn, this time just inside the Rebels’s half. **James**, with his magic boots on, spotted **Evan** at the back post who volleyed past the keeper to make it two.

> 2-0

The Frother tiki-taka football continued, but 15 minutes later, it was the Rebels with a free kick deep in Frother territory. **Dylan**, reading the taker’s mind, intercepted a short pass and released **Yarride**, waiting on the half way line, for a 1-on-1 with the keeper. The keeper, quick off his line, managed to close down Yarride before he could sort his feet and stuck it out for a throw. 

Frothers were good value for their two goal lead going into the break and it didn’t take long for the Froth to be back on display in the second half - **Farshid** released **Lance** down the left hand side with a ball that had enough backspin on it to leave a burn mark on the pitch. It held up nicely, **Lance** inevitably beat the defender and calmly slotted it under the keeper to make it 3-0.

> 3-0

The Frothers had the ball in the back of the BNU net once again, for **Lance** to be questionably ruled offside.

Shortly after, the Frothers drew yet again another foul halfway inside the BNU half. With a routine off the training ground, **Pratik** delivered to the back stick where **Evan** was waiting to nod the ball across the face of goal for **Lance** to sweep in. Yet again, **Lance** was flagged offside, with it turning out post game that David Coote was in charge of lines on VAR.

5 minutes later, the Rebels were at it again, fouling **Lance**, wide on the right side of the pitch. **James**, the man of the moment, stepped up to deliver another pearler. With **Farshid** making a decoy run at the back post, the ball managed to go all the way through and slid past the keeper to make it four.

> 4-0

In a rare venture forwards, the Rebels beat the offside trap with a looping ball over the top for them to put the ball across the face of goal and tap in at the back post to make it 4-1.

> 4-1

This lit a fire inside the BNU bellies, who with 10 to go viciously took out the Frother engine room, **Evan**, with a shot to the nads from a couple of yards. Leaving him writhing in pain, the attacker fled the scene. Crime Stoppers NZ are asking for anybody with information regarding the assailant to please come forward.

## MOTM & DOTD

The Frothers were Frothing for the 90, but two stand out performances taking the awards, having shone from dead ball situations for very different reasons. **James** taking MOTM for his two goals and assist and **Evan H** taking DOTD for taking the absolute missile to the nuts.

The Boys are so back.

The Frothers were looking at turning the script on when they last played Paddys where we went down in a shoot out.

The First half was full of Frothers chances, with shots raining down on the Paddys goal from every angle. Lance even tried a filthy bicycle kick on.

## Halftime

All the attacking output didn't result in anything and the teams went into the break level.

As the second half progressed it looked like it was going to be the same story, with clear goal scoring opportunities being limited.

It took the old Frothers' staple combination to break the deadlock. Lance played in Yarride, who managed to clear his feet and place the shot right in the corner.

> 1-0

It was still a bit nervy with only a 1 goal lead and a Paddys launching balls over the top.

**Declan** starts off an attacking play with a filthy nutmeg, the ball was then passed quickly between a few of the boys. **Lance** made sure of it, however and put the Frothers 2 up with minutes to spare.

> 2-0

## Man of the Match

A much needed clean sheet and some quality saves to go along with it, Ryan picks up the man of the match

## Dick of the Day

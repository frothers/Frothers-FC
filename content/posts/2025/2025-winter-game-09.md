With the slots for the season pretty much sorted, the eventual meeting of two of the top teams didn't have a whole lot to play for. 
The boys, out of the goodness for their hearts, decided that keeping the club liquid was the issue du jour, and winning could wait.

After two weeks off and some suspect pool, the boys were surprisingly quick at the gates and looked to take the confusion of the league title to a further game. This was not the case.
As you have no doubt already seen, the game was a bit of a blowout. It was still competitive, but had some moments of carnage, and ofcourse plenty of fineable content.

The first goal was a game of hot potato between Ian and Farshid ðŸ’¸.

The third goal was a good old fashioned ankle tap penalty from Ian ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸. The resulting penalty was dragged wide. Drama ensued as the ref decided that Farshid had come off his line. The following penalty was bashed in.

> Upon further inspection of the rules this was found to be a fictitious law, the club are considering their options.

Evan picked up a yellow before halftime ðŸ’¸.

## Halftime 

Another half, another set of calamities.

Jacob was in goal and decided he wanted to chance his arm at a penalty ðŸ’¸. Levering over the striker, he got his chance. Picked wrong, however.

Some good old fashioned pettiness from Patty to get a yellow ðŸ’¸.

Stu, back for a exhabition match before fatherhood, managed to pop the ball into Evan's face ðŸ’¸.

## Post Match
Some suspect dealings at the pub from Declan ðŸ’¸.

## Man of the match
**Jacob** put in a shift in keeper, having to save several one-on-ones. Also looking more comfortable leading the line every week. And still managed to pay the bills.

## Dick of the day 
**Farshid** somehow came out with positive fines this week, the international markets all took a nosedive ðŸ“‰, nothing is true anymore.

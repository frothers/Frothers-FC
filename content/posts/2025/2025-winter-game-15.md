It was one of those days where the Frothers showed up with 11 bodies, 10 hearts, and 0 luck.

The game kicked off with optimism in the air… for about 9 minutes. Then Ian, full of promise and preseason hope, pulled something (his hammy, his groin, maybe his dignity), and gracefully bowed out of the match like a Victorian damsel fainting in a Jane Austen novel.

Down to 10 men with 80+ minutes to go, the Frothers dug deep. Really deep. Like Mariana Trench levels of deep.
But sadly, it was like trying to plug a leaky submarine with Blu Tack. One goal slipped through… then another… and another.
The scoreboard looked like a cruel joke, but anyone watching knew the Frothers were fighting with everything they had—and one man down.

## Hero of the Day

Hugo. Solo right-back warrior. After Ian abandoned the wing like it was a sinking ship, Hugo stayed behind to defend the flank like it was sacred land. Man of the Match, no question. May his calves recover swiftly.

## Dick of the Day

Ian. For trying to claim a clean sheet bonus after 10 minutes of cardio, two touches, and a gentle jog off the field.
Nice try mate. But you don’t get a medal for showing up and immediately clocking out.

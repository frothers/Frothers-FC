A week off which was welcome news for the wounded to come crawling back into the fold. A cold and windy afternoon at Wellington college welcomed the boys back.

Up against a pelicans side who were push overs last time we played, the Frothers thought we were in again when in the first minutes of the game Farshid was scything into the box after a good ball through by Declan. A late challenge after entering the box was enough to get the ref to call the penalty.

Taking the ball himself, **Farshid** managed to not only put it on target but get enough juice on it that the keepers hand to it was ineffectual.

> 1-0

It was too good to be true, the boys were battling to form cohesive attacks from then.

Before the end of the half **Evan** tried a cross clearance. There is a reason they haven't caught on, however. The Pelicans player latched onto it and levelled the score.

> 1-1

## Halftime

The boys managed to keep the frost bite away and headed back out for another greasey half.

After a half of battling it was looking like it would be a stalemate. But after 80 minutes of play the Frothers got their first corner of the match, and the boys didn't need to be asked twice.

A back post cross by **James** was met by **Michael** for his first Frothers goal with a header just inside the post.

> 2-1

## Man of the Match
After about 100 headers, including the match winner, **Michael** takes award for a great game.

## Dick of the Day
Looking like a bad piece of AI corporate imagery, **Ryan** managed to grab the award by bringing two right hand gloves to the match.

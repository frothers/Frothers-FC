## Cup Final - A repeat of last years final

Another year, another cup final for the Frothers. The whanau and the injured were out in force to cheer on the boys with the hope that if Spurs can break their cup hoodoo, so can the Frothers.

The Frothers started out strong with Farshid repeatedly breaking the line, first to hit the keeper in a one-on-one, but making amends with the second.

> 1-0

The Frothers weren't able to hold the lead for long, however. **Evan**, always the provider, managed to time a tackle to perfectly bounce the ball into the path of the Koffi striker. I'm going to start needing to take these off his tally.

> 1-1

Koffi were able to strike again in quick succession by taking advantage of a day dreaming touch judge to circumnavigate the offside trap and net their second.

> 1-2

The Frothers managed to hit straight back with a snap through ball from **James** following an exchange of possession. **Andy** didn't need to be asked twice.

> 2-2

The half was rounded out by a bouncing ball following a corner that the Koffi managed to poke into the back of the net.

> 2-3

## Half time

The game was open and the Frothers knew they could take it out if they could find a little consistency in the second half.

It could not have started worse, however. Losing the ball in midfield the Koffi forward dribbled at an angle and managed to find the far corner with a shot at the edge of the box.

> 2-4

Luckily, the Frothers had a bona fide gamebreaker on their hands with **Andy** who stormed into the box and got taken out. **Lance** stepped up for the pen and got the Frothers back within touching distance.

> 3-4

Don't. Let. It. Slip

Seemingly the very next play disaster struck. Farshid picked the ball up in midfield and had an eternity to turn, but he hadn't seen the oil slick. Skating like he was up against Steven Bradbury, Farshid could only hit the deck and watch the Koffi player hit a shot from range off the post to extend their lead.

> 3-5

The winds of fate were well and truly in Koffi's favour. A nothing ball over the top which was destined for a goal kick suddenly became a golden ticket as the ref decided that a coming together between Patrick and the attacker warranted a penalty.

Koffi managed to put the peno away to all but extinguish the Frother hopes.

> 3-6

A great run by Oli helped set-up Andy to sit down the Koffi backline and claw another one back.

> 4-6

But it wouldn't be enough and the Frothers would need to settle with second in the league and the cup.

## Man of the Match
Tireless work, even when it looked it everything was lost. **Oli** picks it up for the last game.

## Dick of the Day
Well well well.

I was hoping that by the time I was writing the match report I would have the Veo footage to of some certain incidents to soothe the wounds, but they appear to be locked up tighter than the Epstein files.

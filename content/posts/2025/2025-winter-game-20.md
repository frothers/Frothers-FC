## Cup Final - A repeat of last years final

Another year, another cup final for the Frothers. The whanau and the injured were out in force to cheer on the boys with the hope that if Spurs can break their cup hoodoo, so can the Frothers.

The Frothers started out strong with Farshid repeatedly breaking the line, first to hit the keeper in a one-on-one, but making amends with the second.

> 1-0

The Frothers weren't able to hold the lead for long, however. **Evan**, always the provider, managed to time a tackle to perfectly bounce the ball into the path of the Koffi striker. I'm going to start needing to take these off his tally.

> 1-1

Koffi were able to strike again in quick succession by taking advantage of a day dreaming touch judge to circumnavigate the offside trap and net their second.

> 1-2

The Frothers managed to hit straight back with a snap throughball from **James** following an exchange of possession. **Andy** didn't need to be asked twice.

> 2-2

The half was rounded out by a bouncing ball following a corner that the Koffi managed to poke into the back of the net.

> 2-3

## Half time

The game was open and the Frothers knew they could take it out if they could find a little consistency in the second half.

It could not have started worse, however. Losing the ball in midfield the Koffi forward dribbled at an angle and managed to find the far corner with a shot at the edge of the box.

> 2-4

Luckily, the Frothers had a bona fide gamebreaker on their hands with **Andy** who stormed into the box and got taken out. **Lance** stepped up for the pen and got the Frothers back within touching distance.

> 3-4

Don't. Let. It. Slip

Seemingly the very next play disaster struck. Farshid picked the ball up in midfield and had an eternity to turn, but he hadn't seen the oil slick. Skating like he was up against Steven Bradbury, Farshid could only hit the deck and watch the Koffi player hit a shot from range off the post to extend their lead.

> 3-5

Koffi managed to get another to all but extinguish the Frother hopes.

A great run by Oli helped set-up Andy to sit down the Koffi backline, but it wouldn't be enough.

> 4-6

## Man of the Match
Tireless work, even when it looked it everything was lost. Oli picks it up for the last game.

## Dick of the Day
well well well.

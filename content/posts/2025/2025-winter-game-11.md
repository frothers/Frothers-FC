Second half of the season kicks off with a grudge match. Always a tight match up, Koffis had a typically solid team again at Wellington college. 

The Frothers had some ball players too, and had the better of the possession for most of the first half. Sadly the final ball was lacking and the Frothers were showing as much variety as a South Island flatmate's meal selection. 

## Halftime

A tight match and some good controlled football, the Frothers rolled into the second half looking for a goal to break the game open. The aerial threat proved to almost be the provider, with Grainger being denied from a great Oli ball in, and Jacob hitting the upright from a corner.

The fortunes flipped as the ball came down the other end, however. Milan was caught guilty of having a tickle at the striker in the box and a penalty was awarded. A stutter step run-up was enough to sent Ryan the wrong way.

Milan would be seen waiting in the carpark after the game.

## Man of the match
**Grainger** has two attempts that could very well have been goals saved by the opponent's goalkeeper. Hope he was taking notes. Also, picking up a yellow to keep Patrick M honest.

## Dick of the day 
**Chris**, in Milan's last match for the Frothers throwing him under the bus after the match by agreeing in some part with Mike.

## Haere RƒÅ

We bid farewell to **Milan** who is off to China and **Grainger** who is back off to the US of A. Different careers, 4 goals in 6 and 2 in 127, both will be missed.

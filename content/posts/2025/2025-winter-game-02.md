An early game after daylight savings and a few boys deciding to hit the town the night before saw the Frothers already scrambling for ring-ins. Up against a V-Well team with 6+ subs the Frothers could well be in store for a up hill battle.

Farshid was back for his first game of the season and wasted no time getting in players faces, rolling on the ground, and making the ref get the cards out. Fortunately this was an opposition red card this time. Throwing the ball at the lifeless form of Farshid is a quick way to get yourself and early seat on the sideline.

Frothers toiled to get the breakthrough. V Well actually came closest, with a fine save from Ryan from a header.

Finally the corner routine paid off against the vertically challenged V Well. Oli's delivery found Evan who nodded strongly home, leaving the keeper rooted to the spot.

> 1-0

## Halftime

The boys knew they just needed to settle and use the possession to see this game through.


## MotM 

Scoring in three games in a row this goes to el capitan, Chris.

## DotD

Milan. Boofing the ball into Ryan's face before the match finished this race before it had even started.

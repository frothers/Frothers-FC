An early game after daylight savings and a few boys deciding to hit the town the night before saw the Frothers already scrambling for ring-ins. Up against a V-Well team with 6+ subs the Frothers could well be in store for a up hill battle.

> Enter the shit house

Farshid was back for his first game of the season and wasted no time getting in players faces, rolling on the ground, and making the ref get the cards out. Fortunately this was an opposition red card this time. Throwing the ball at the lifeless form of Farshid is a quick way to get yourself and early seat on the sideline.

Frothers toiled to get the breakthrough. V Well actually came closest, with a fine save from Ryan from a header.

Finally the corner routine paid off against the vertically challenged V Well. Oli's delivery found Evan who nodded strongly home, leaving the keeper rooted to the spot.

> 1-0

## Halftime

The boys knew they just needed to settle and use the possession to see this game through.

Tim didn't give up on a ball all the way to the touchline. The keeper managed a save, but the defender (under pressure from Patrick) managed to pass it straight back to Tim who finished this time.

> 2-0

The boys were in their heads now. A corner to the Frothers was delivered and a defender fearing a repeat of Evan's goal decided that wrestling Chris to the ground for a penalty was a better bet than another header.

Chris stepped up himself and left the keeper flat footed and needing to pick the ball out of the net. 

> 3-0

Another dangerous cross,this time by Patrick, and another rogue decision by the V Well defenders. This time it was a header into their own net.

> 4-0

Goals are on offer, enter Yarride. Meant to be parenting, Yarride managed to start the Frother creche to sneak onto the field. The first involvement was to watch a defender completely misstime a header and stroll through to a goal.

> 5-0

## MotM 

Scoring in three games in a row this goes to el capitan, Chris.

## DotD

Milan. Boofing the ball into Ryan's face before the match finished this race before it had even started.

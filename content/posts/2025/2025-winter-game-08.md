Back at the Prince of Wales, the Frothers were up again the familiar opposition of Loko.

The Frothers were used to a certain quality of life that a rare 4 directional wind combined with a pitch that has a couple healthy bumps was at odds with. 

It was a classic Sunday league hit it up type of match. Bombed balls rained supreme. 

## First half

The Frothers took an early lead from a set piece, a long freekick from James was headed back in by Patrick and Jacob turned it on target. A save from the keeper and some black magic saw the ball end up in the back of the net. 

> 1-0

Loko decided it was time for operation make it Rayn. Balls over the top at Ian was the name of the game, but couldn't make anything of the second ball.

The Frothers didn't have much more luck either, with every ball through rocketing to the keeper. 

## Halftime 

The second half saw a lot of Frothers shots from the edge of the box, but the Loko keeper was able to deal with them. 

Disaster struct later in the half when Patrick and Chris closed the door in the Loko striker who decided to go to the ground. Coward.

Shed 1 Greg stepped up and sent Ryan the wrong way.

> 1-1

Moments later the Frothers were back. A header on by Evan saw Farshid take two Aussie rules touches to round the keeper and turn the ball towards goal where it just crossed the line.

> 2-1

Patrick even pulled out the Farshid homage by sending the returned ball for a hotdog after the goal.

The Frothers had led for the whole match, but a smash and grab in the last minutes meant the points were shared.

What else but a full field tonk from the CB which allowed the winger to split Ian and Ryan to head in from the edge of the box.

> 2-2

 
## Man of the Match
Back from visiting La Masia, Declan always seemed to have time on the ball and was a consistent outlet. Hugo also had a great game. Mt Cook 

## Dick of the Day
Wearing the laundry day special all white kit, Ryan managed to get penalized for a pass back from 20m out.

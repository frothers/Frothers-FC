It was a crisp Wellington afternoon, and Frothers FC showed up in their royal purple, ready to dance with the Blazers who, judging by their early goal, came dressed for business.

## First Half
Blazers struck early, catching Frothers still adjusting their shin pads and Spotify playlists. 1-0. A classic Frothers start.

> 0-1

But then came the moment of magic: Farshid, clearly having watched Pirlo’s Greatest Hits on YouTube the night before, delivered a chef’s kiss of a pass to Jacob, who coolly slotted it in. 1-1. Chaos on the sideline. Farshid immediately asked to be subbed off so he could bask in the applause.

> 1-1

But just when we thought we’d see out the half, confusion struck in the box. Ryan seemingly had the ball—until it wasn’t in his hands anymore and had instead found its way into the back of the net. A mysterious sequence that VAR is still trying to decode.

> 2-1 Blazers.

## Second Half
Frothers came out swinging, dominating possession like prime Barcelona, minus the goals. Passes were flying, triangles were forming, and vibes were immaculate but the net remained untouched.

Blazers, on the other hand, had no time for beautiful football. One counter, one shot, one goal.

> 3-1.

Frothers’ midfield cried softly into their shin guards.

## Man of the Match
Jacob. Scored a goal, ran more kilometres than anyone, and somehow played right wing, left back, striker, and physio, all at once.

## Dick of the Day
Patrick M, who took "rice and repeat" to a whole new level by trying to deal rice mid-game. Still unsure if it was basmati, jasmine, or just confusion.

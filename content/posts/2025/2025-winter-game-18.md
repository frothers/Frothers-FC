Fresh off the end of year celebration with a handful of new awards being distributed around the squad the boys were out to solidify their standing, or prove the haters wrong.

> Yash is out of the running for storm trooper on a technicality

> Chris has now equalled Yash's all time record

Arfter a tense start to the match it was time for the real Yash Rosario to return. Collecting a ball on the edge of the box from wreckage of a trivela from James, Yash lashed home an unstoppable shot that went coast-to-coast off the posts before finally nestling in the net.

## Man of the Match
Bossing the midfield, having a screamer just tipped over the bar, and scoring the important first goal, **Oli** was today's chosen one.

The force is strong with this one

## Dick of the Day
To be honest, the picking were slim, so the award goes to the Frother who gave into greed and decided to go for goal from the first corner of the game, even though the Frothers now have the title of master at corners. Hold on... is that a moon?

That's no moon, its a beat up old black sweatshirt. **The Shokoohi strikes back**

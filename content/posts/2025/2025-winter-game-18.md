Fresh off the end of year celebration with a handful of new awards being distributed around the squad the boys were out to solidify their standing, or prove the haters wrong.

After a tense start to the match it was time for the return of Yash Rosario. Collecting a ball on the edge of the box from wreckage of a trivela from James, Yash lashed home an unstoppable shot that went coast-to-coast off the posts before finally nestling in the net.

> 1-0

With the goal scorers race all but sewn up, it was time for **Yarride** to make his yearly play for all the remaining silverware. With the backline heading them home for fun lately, Yarride just had to pick his spot on the corner. This time it was **Michael** at the back post, with a skidding bouncing header to sneak inside the post.

> 2-0

## Halftime
The boys were back in the shed to avoid the bitter wind and rain for a couple minutes.

The Frothers started the half well in control, dismantling any threat that Loko tried to raise. The only real threat came from a mix-up at the back that turned out to be **Ryan** smurfing so he could pull off a spectacular diving save for the fans.

Not long after **Oli** was played in and with another trivela cross found **Yash** in the middle who took him time for a touch and finish.

> 3-0

The boys won themselves another corner and the big boys were up again. Yet again **Yarride** cut the keeper out of the equation with a ball to 2m out from the back post. **Jacob** met it with a clean volley off the larynx to make it 4.

> 4-0

After about 100 offsides for the boys up top Evan finally managed to spring the offside trap and cut one back to Yarride. Taking a touch around the keeper he was able to hold off the recovering CB to pass into an open net.

> 5-0


## Man of the Match
One man was out to prove the haters wrong.

> Yash is out of the running for storm trooper on a technicality

> Chris has now equalled Yash's all time record

Waiting for the knock out footy, **Yash** turned on a master class to help wrap-up the match. With both of the brothers putting in a great performance they were really cementing the dynasty.

## Dick of the Day
This man couldn't stay out of the headlines this week. Picking up the coveted MVP award, **Jacob** was in the drama all over the pitch.

From bullying a poor hyped up youth, shielding a ball that was 10 metres away, scoring off his gullet, or pulling off one of the worst looking dives for a tackle that he only had 10 minutes to get out of the way of.

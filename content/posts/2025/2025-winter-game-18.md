Fresh off the end of year celebration with a handful of new awards being distributed around the squad the boys were out to solidify their standing, or prove the haters wrong.

After a tense start to the match it was time for the real Yash Rosario to return. Collecting a ball on the edge of the box from wreckage of a trivela from James, Yash lashed home an unstoppable shot that went coast-to-coast off the posts before finally nestling in the net.

> 1-0

With the goal scorers race all but sewn up, it was time for Yarride to make his yearly play for all the remaining silverware. With all of the backline heading them home for fun lately Yarride just had to pick his spot on the corner. This time it was Michael at the back post, with a skidding bouncing header to sneak inside the post.

> 2-0

## Halftime



## Man of the Match
One man was out to prove the haters wrong.

> Yash is out of the running for storm trooper on a technicality

> Chris has now equalled Yash's all time record

Waiting for the knock out footy, **Yash** turned on a master class to help wrap-up the match.

## Dick of the Day
To be honest, the picking were slim, so the award goes to the Frother who gave into greed and decided to go for goal from the first corner of the game, even though the Frothers now have the title of master at corners. Hold on... is that a moon?

That's no moon, its a beat up old black sweatshirt. **The Shokoohi strikes back**

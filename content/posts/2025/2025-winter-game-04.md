The boys were back on the grass on a pitch a stones throw from Hugo and Declan's casa. This was a classic Wellington pitch, where not only had no one played in it, just people didn't know it existed.

## First Half
Fresh off an adrenaline fuelled watching of El Classico, Shokoohi fancied himself a bit of a Pedro distance shooting. Luckily on target was as good as a top bins shot in Sunday league. 

> 1-0

But just when we thought we’d see out the half, confusion struck in the box. Ryan seemingly had the ball—until it wasn’t in his hands anymore and had instead found its way into the back of the net. A mysterious sequence that VAR is still trying to decode.

> 2-1 Blazers.

## Second Half
Frothers came out swinging, dominating possession like prime Barcelona, minus the goals. Passes were flying, triangles were forming, and vibes were immaculate but the net remained untouched.

Blazers, on the other hand, had no time for beautiful football. One counter, one shot, one goal.

> 3-1.

Frothers’ midfield cried softly into their shin guards.

## Man of the Match
Jacob. Scored a goal, ran more kilometres than anyone, and somehow played right wing, left back, striker, and physio, all at once.

## Dick of the Day
Patrick M, who took "rice and repeat" to a whole new level by trying to deal rice mid-game. Still unsure if it was basmati, jasmine, or just confusion.

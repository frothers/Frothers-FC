The boys were back on a classic Wellington pitch, hidden away down a cul-de-sac with uneven grass and more bumps than a Friday evening landing.

## First Half
Fresh off an adrenaline fuelled watching of El Classico, Shokoohi fancied himself a bit of Pedro distance shooting. Luckily on target was as good as top bins in Sunday league. 

> 1-0

The next goal came about with a bit of drama in the build up. Yarride was through against the keeper and knocked it past him. The keeper decided that he was taking matters into his own hands. Somehow staying on the patch, the keeper only delayed the inevitable. Yarride's floated freekick to the backpost went uncontested, until Patrick wiped his fringe on it to claim the goal.

> 2-0

To lift the spirits of the Cobham boys, Chris decided to pass it right to their striker to allow them to get back into the game before halftime.

> 2-1


## Second Half
Frothers felt like they were well in control of the game, but with only a single goal lead they needed to make sure of things.

It wasn't long before Yarride got his goal. A good piece of back and forth on the edge of the box with James resulted in some space to drive a low shot past the keeper.

> 3-1

A corner got the Frothers firmly in control, as Evan met the ball at the back post and sent it pinballing into the net off a few players. The gloves were off now.

> 4-1

Yarride then got through on goal and had all day to sit the keeper down and chip it home.

> 5-1

Lance broke through and cut it back to Evan who put it under the keeper.

> 6-1

It turned into a straight up exhibition match. Boys doing skill moves with no pay-off, stupid long range efforts from lads who struggle to kick the ball out of the box on the full.

Luckily Chris stepped up to put some good old fashioned Sunday football back on the menu. Winning the ball in a 1-on-1 Chris stepped on the ball, rolling an ankle, and went hand to hand with the reaper for 6 rounds.

> 6-2

Fittingly for a game after Easter it was the resurrection of Chris. Driving the ball forward in the next play he freed Yarride who crossed it in to Evan to emphatically volleyed it home for his third and the perfect hattrick.

> 7-2

## Man of the Match
His first hattrick for the club and a good day at the office for the menace in the midfield, Evan.

## Dick of the Day
Paying homage to 2018 Charles Daily with the rolled ankle on the deflated netball and unashamedly blaming the boys for the first goal, it is your favorite, Chris.

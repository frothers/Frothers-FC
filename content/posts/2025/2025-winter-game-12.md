Up against Marks Ave, who were sporting a different line-up to recent memory.

The Frothers were sporting their own Sol Campbell in the form of Angus, who was back to take on his old team.

Mark Ave had the majority of the control in the first half. The Frothers finding it hard to find their structure. Mark Ave managed to grab the lead through a passback that Ryan tried to put some extra sauce on 🙈.

> 0-1

The Frothers braintrust on the sideline made some changes to hopefully plug the holes, moving to the old 4-3-3 to give some more support out wide.

Not long after, the Frothers were back in it. Some great work down the wing by Jacob was followed by a peach of a ball which Farshid, playing on the right, drove into the bottom corner.

> 1-1

## Halftime
The boys were feeling it a bit more, though still having to work for it.

A dubious passback resulted in a freekick on the left wing, don't ask, the resulting ball in found its way to Oli, who managed to volley it straight into the Mark Ave defenders arm on the line. Penalty.

The boys didn't fancy it and pulled Chris up from deep to give him a chance to add to his tally for the season. Sending the keeper the wrong way the Frothers were in the lead!

> 2-1

A few minutes later and it was Declan targetting handballs, a more outreached arm, but the same result. 🅿️ester was back to aura farm, going the same way, with the same outcome.

> 3-1

The Frothers were getting into the flow now. Farshid, looking like a different beast out on that right, ripped a low cross in to Yarride who finished with aplomb. 

> 4-1

Mark Ave managed to pull one back with a shot from the edge of the box that got a tragic **over** call from Angus, before sneaking under the bar.

> 4-2

The Frothers were in the trenches for the last couple minutes, with Lance axing anyone that moved, and Yarride trying to deplete the ball stocks of the league by sending ball after ball into orbit.

The boys held on for a well fought win.

## Man of the Match
Some good contenders this week. Big shout out to anyone giving up a pen to your boy. Jacob with some more great forward work. This week it goes to Farshid for defying the haters and putting in a master class down the right.

## Dick of the Day
Some good laughs out there. A sniper was in full effect bringing down the boys. Some terrible trevella atempts from Evan and Ryan, one leading to a goal. Yarride had the pitching wedge out for everything except his goal. This week it goes to Angus, who was having a full aneurysm because of half a dozen things. Breakup Brain.

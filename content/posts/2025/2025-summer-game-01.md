An absolute hit out

- Yarride scored 4 identical toe poke goals
- Lance grafted for a couple goals
- Chris scored a looped header from 6 yards and was gifted a 90th minute brace 
- Patrick finished off a well crafted move
- Jacob calmly first timed one
- Evan blasted a few at the keeper and eventually one went through
- Ian snuck in for a sweaty goal

## MotM 

Birthday boy Lance. Hard work chasing through ball after through ball. All the boys benefitted from the work he put in.

## DotD

Milan. A needless yellow for getting handsy and trying to claim an assist for playing a ball that lead to another Frother getting a touch, the defender trying to clear it, the keeper picking it up, dropping it, and it getting toed in by Chris

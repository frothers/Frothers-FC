Boys got some goals.

## Man of the Match
Missing out last week, **Farshid** worked hard at both ends to make sure not one scored this week.


## Dick of the Day
In a no-win situation in the backline **James** was up against a 14 year old. Don't hurt him and don't get sat down by him. Well at least he didn't hurt him.

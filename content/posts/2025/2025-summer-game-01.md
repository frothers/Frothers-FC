An absolute hit out

- Yarride scored 4 identical toe poke goals
- Lance grafted for a couple goals
- Chris scored a looped header from 6 yards and was gifted a 90th minute brace 
- Patrick finished off a well crafted move
- Jacob calmly first timed one
- Evan blasted a few at the keeper and eventually one went through
- Ian snuck in for a sweaty goal

## MotM 

Birthday boy Lance. Hard work chasing through ball after through ball. All the boys benefitted from the work he put in.

## DotD

Ryan Kindell. Not once, but twice did he to go Neuer and try to take some players on. Almost coming through with the red card challenge in one of the instances. Give him one game out of goal and it goes straight to the head.

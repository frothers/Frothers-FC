5pm in the wind and the rain at St Pats.

Pickings were slim with a few injuries over the last week. Oli decided to also risk the onset of hypothermia to back the boys, making an early play for Frother of the year. 

Luckily the boys were able to recruit some new ring in talent to bolster the ranks this week. The theme was USA, with Grainger back for summer break for playing GK in the states, and Michael donning the state trooper moustache and straight cut look.

## First half

It was slick and fast out there, with balls over the top scooting through to the keeper. The Frothers decided it was time to showcase their ranged shooting. 

First off was Yarride, who mopped up a ball outside the box. With the keeper well out of position all that was needed was a shot on target. Yarride decided that it was top bins or nothing.

> 1-0

Next up a classic Farshid run kicked off a move across the box where Yarride set up Evan to drive home a shot to the bottom left of the goal.

> 2-0

Next up was Grainger, who also laced one into the bottom corner.

> 3-0

The Pelicans had a late chance, with a mix up the Pelicans player was charging through. Michael stepped in the with the big Don't Resist to stop the attack and receive the first yellow of the night.

## Halftime

Some of the boys thought we had it sewn up. Saying it was as certain as a Metservice forecast. The captain had to step in and check a couple of egos to make sure the boys kept focus.

It wasn't long before the Pelicans came back. A throw in back to Ryan saw him drop a Ronaldinho move to flick it up and a clearance to the Pelican strikers. The Frothers backline were still mesmerised and just watched the Pelis drive through.

> 3-1

The boys decided it was time to get real. Stringing a dozen good passes together, switching sides, a deep chipped cross by Yarride was headed back inside by Hugo, with Jacob getting in front of his man to guide it home.

> 4-1

After a few corners were held up in the wind, Evan managed to deliver an absolute gem off the left foot. Chris was able to raise highest and hit a bounce header into the net.

> 5-1

The boys started to smell there may be goals here, and Yarride isn't one to miss out. A slaloming run into the box and a neat finish around the keeper. The celebration was a bit much though.

> 6-1

Evan dropped a filthy meg in the box and pick up his second.

> 7-1

Grainger was denied a second goal by a dubious offside call, was was fed by Jacob moments later to get his second.

> 8-1

## Man of the Match
Some beautiful play down the wing and showing the other boys how to handle a bit of rough and tumble, Hugo picks up the award this week.  


## Dick of the Day
Some princesses took exception to a little bit of heat in the cold and want your boy to pick it up, but History is written by the victors. Also, I cannot go past my boy Farshid.

> A truly virtuoso performance. 

🙏 An "assist" by pinging it off the backside of the defender

🙏 A hockey assist by stumbling over the ball, just to nutmeg the defender and then square it up to open the play

🙏 3 separate incidents of getting the opposition to kick the ball out for supposed injuries + a yellow card to top it off

🙏 Must have thought he was playing rugby after that, as the conversion from being through on goal was pinpoint

We are truely blessed.

Special shoutout to Yarride for disconnected the controller and almost jogged the ball out for a throw-in at one point.

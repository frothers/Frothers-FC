Mid season break and back to a bit of cup magic. The boys were struggling for numbers until hours before kickoff. Yet somehow managed to wrangle 4 subs by match time. 


## Man of the match
He's no dead yet! **Milan** 

## Dick of the day 
**Yarride** it takes something special to score a hattrick and still have your output put under the microscope. 1-on-1s, headers into empty nets, keeper off his line? You name it, he missed it. It took a moment of generosity from MVP **Milan** to cap off the hattrick.

## Shithouse of the day

The Frothers continued their illfated start to the first half of summer league with another comfy loss. Mathematically safe from Div 1 after Christmas, the boys can have a bit of fun before the break.

## Man Of the Match
As is becoming standard now, the man between the ticks picks up a MOTM nod, with **Jimmy** doing the honours this week.

## Dick of the day
A real treat for the weary of heart was watching **Ryan M** absolutely axing the striker from behind in a situation of little danger. Looking to do something similar with the final kick of the game, except with no opposition and resulting in an injured knee was prime DoTD material 🧑‍🍳😙🤌

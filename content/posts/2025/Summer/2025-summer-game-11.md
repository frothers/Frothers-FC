Div 2, back in the promise land. Surely the Frothers were going to be back to the silky footy the fans are used to...

> 0-1

Practically straight off the kickoff the Frothers were behind from a filthy dummy nutmeg which the striker was able to race onto to open the scoring.

Not long later suspicions of a ringer started to surface as the same placer was again through following a wind assisted through ball snuck through.

> 0-2

What came next is scandalous. The same player managed to pick the ball up in the box and executed a scoop turn nutmeg. However, seeing the ball was lost a shocking dive was produced to extend the lead.

> 3-0

The Frothers managed to pull one back through a set peice. After having his header saved by the keeper, Chris was able to recycle the ball to Evan who finished it first-time.

> 1-3

Liam saw it was a pretty one dimensional attacking approach from the opposition and took it upon himself to make sure the love was shared around by picking out their other striker from the open play.

> 1-4

## Halftime 

Ryan M has seen enough and headed off at halftime with Lance hot on his heels.

the second half saw another corner goal from Evan, who turned home James' cross.

Another couple goals to Turkish rug too for some more chipped through balls.

## Man of the Match
With most of the boys still weighed down by their Christmas dinners Evan put in his usual shift and got two goals for it.

## Dick of the day
Victim of onfield officiating and backroom politics, Chris was made this week's scapegoat for rolling a sub. Free Kobbie Mainoo

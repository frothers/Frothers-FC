The Frothers were out to lock-up a much converted relegation spot, and short of calling up big Ange to hemorrhage points they continued the goalkeeper roulette.

The boys got off to a rough start with a hopeful shot from range catching the keeper out and only able to bat it into the net.

> 0-1

Loko were able to double their lead with a gift of a penalty, with a mix up at the back resulting in a charging keeper cleaning out the striker with the ball almost certainly going out for a goal kick.

The resulting penalty was neatly tucked into the corner.

> 0-2

**Yarride** was able to pop up later in the half to bang a goal back.

> 1-2

## Halftime
A nonchalant halftime huddle summed up the hunger of the boys on the day.

The second half must have seen the wind switch, as the Frothers still weren't able to link up play effectively, and it was a matter of time before Loko struck again.

A cross was swatted out as far as a the 6 yard box and the approaching Loko player jumped highest.

> 1-3

Caught playing with the ball, the keeper then gave a Loko player got the easier goal of his life as it pinged off his knee and into the goal from 20 out.

> 1-4


## Man of the Match
Camera Man's favourite, the people's choice award goes to Oli. Coming off the back of a wild-one Oli managed to ride the high to catch the eye.

## Dick of the Day
With a job to do to put the Frothers in prime position for Div 2 the big man was a little over eager to make his mark. With a hand in all 4 goals, even Hugo was giving out some choice remarks.

A wholesale change from Tuesday where only two of the line-up remained the same. It was also the return of a couple of faces in Lance and Ian.

In classic Frothers fashion what was meant to be a 5 man bench turned out to be a single spare spot, with at least 4 of the boys putting their hands up for limited minutes.

## Man of the Match
Keeping with tradition it was the goalie again who got MotM. After some interesting positioning for the first headed goal, Patrick didn't put a foot wrong for the remainder of the match.

## Dick of the Day

> After back to back games with no subs, this weekend we have 15 so if you do have any niggles and would like a weekend off, this is time to do it. 

Unhinged. **Yarride Rosario**

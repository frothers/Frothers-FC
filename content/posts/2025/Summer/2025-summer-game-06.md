Midweek game played without lights, it is truly into the summer season.

The Frothers were up against a Sudakas team who thoroughly beat them last time out, and with the mixed up line-up anything could have happened.

The Frothers started strong with decent possession and a few good opportunities to go ahead.
It was Sudakas who struck first, however. **James** go isolated with the ball and could only manage a back pass half the way back to goal which the striker was able to pick up and round the keeper for an easy goal.

> 0-1

It didn't take the Frothers long to get back into it. A lovely whipped in corner by **Pete** was attacked by **Staples**. The Accies boys teaming up to level the game.

> 1-1

There were a couple more good chances to finish the half, two well delivered crosses by **James** led to a near miss and hitting the crossbar.

## Halftime

Halftime saw the departure of **Jacob** ,the depletion of the Frothers bench, and really the end of any slick build-up play for the Frothers.

The boys dug deep in the second half and weathered a barrage of attacks to keep parity.

Sudakus finally managed to manufacture a 1-on-1 with **Yarride** who was looking more like a pirate than a CB due to his bung eye and limp by this stage of the game.

> 1-2

## Man of the Match
Some valiant efforts this week. **James** put in a tonne of work to make up of the early game hiccup. **Yarride** let me go up for the last minute corner only to have to put in a last ditch tackle to prevent the open goal, fully pulling his hammy in the process.

The award this week goes to the man with plot armour who pretty much had to put in a all but spotless game in goal to try wash away the shame of the past. **Chris**


## Dick of the Day
Its not a Charles Daily match without his hat in the ring. From minute 5 he was putting is hand up for offsides to prevent covering his man. 

James can have it though.

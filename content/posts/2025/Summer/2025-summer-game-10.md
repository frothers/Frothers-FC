A much better showing from the boys in purple.

## Man Of the Match
Some great work and powerful running, including a busting run to set-up **Kindell** for a goal. **Hunter** get MotM for a great display.

## Dick of the day
Promising himself that he wouldn't go up for headers, **Declean** broke his promise to himself for an uncontested header in the middle of the park for his first touch. Pour one out for our boy.

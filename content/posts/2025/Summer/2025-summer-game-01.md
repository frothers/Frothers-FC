Summer season kicked off with the annual Grading/Cup Games to showcase the Frothersâ€™ proud heritage of match fixing. This year it was FC Joe who had the joy of coming up against the Purple Reign trying to lose and get relegated to Division 2. 

The first half was a sloppy affair with Frothers creating plenty of chances and gloriously putting the final ball anywhere but the old onion bag despite some average goalkeeping on display. **Ryan K** was making the most of his summer foray into the outfield, linking nicely upfront with **Yash**, while new recruits **Ryan M** and **Jake** were making impressive starts from the wing back role. 

Unfortunately Joe were not looking too threatening on attack to get Frother hopes up. Whenever the ball did find its way into the box, **Patrick Moore**, forgetting he had gloves on, would hoof it half way to Africa and give himself a few more minutes to recover from his hangover. Later in the half **Yarride** came off the bench to take up his summer CB role which meant goals were surely not too far away for Joe FC. However, in a momentary brain snap, it was **Yarride** dribbling through a few lazy tackles and shooting from distance, slowly curling beyond the keeper and inside the far post. 

> 1-0 to Frothers at the half. 

Drastic measures were required and a tactical change to a back 2 with **Yarride** and **Hugo** the sole defenders brought about a big turn in momentum. As great as **Hugo** was in stopping most attacks, it was always going to result in goals and Joe scored 2 in quick succession to set themselves up for victory. With 5 minutes remaining Yarride found himself in arces of space and thought about kicking it out to run down the clock but seeing **Yash** in the box he thought it was safe to put a beautiful cross on a plate. Somehow though **Yash** got enough face on it to steer it into the open net and tie things up. **Yarride** puts his hand up to apologise after the goal and assist but in reality the dominant play of Evan, Dylan and James in the midfield was to blame for the Frothers getting back into this. 

To penalties, and all of a sudden, **Kindell** was asking to take the gloves back. **Patty Moore** stood firm though, and gave an exemplary lesson in how not to win a shootout, bouncing from side to side without making a single dive or getting a hand anywhere close to a shot. For the Frothers it was **Dylan** and **Jake** up first and brilliantly shot their pens straight at the keeper. **Hugo** stepped up to cleverly keep things close and avoid an investigation into the team. It came down to **Patty Moore** himself to take the final pen with the TAB paying $1.01 for his shot to go onto Adelaide Rd and he duly delivered. Joe FC step into the Cup, Frothers into the Plate and hopefully Div 2. 

No MotM or DotD in grading games but special mention to **Patrick Moore** for both awards. That level of hangover is both impressive and rather worrying for his poor parents but to turn up at the field in that state shows a pure passion for the club that should be applauded. That he was then convinced to take the gloves and stand in goal for 90 minutes shows that he was probably still slightly drunk.

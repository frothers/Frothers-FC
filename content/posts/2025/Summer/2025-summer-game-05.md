The Frothers were out in Petone for the first time in what feels like years. Up against top of the table Valley the boys were hit with some last minute pull-outs to mean it was a 11-on-11 cage match with no sides.

The boys got off to a good start, though. A **Yarride** shot, which the ball boy was already on his way to fetch, managed to deflect off a Valley player into the path of **Farshid** who hit a sweet volley which the Valley keeper could get a hand on, but that ball was going in.

> 1-0

Valley bounced back soon afterwards using a series of overlapping runs which would be a feature of the match for them to break the Frothers defense apart.

> 1-1

They managed another 2 as well.

> 1-3

A charging run from **Farshid** and a cut through ball found **Yarride** who managed to use his left to bring the game a little closer.

> 2-3

## Halftime

That was as close as the boys got, however.

> 2-8

## Man of the Match
Some good shouts for some of the boys who kept putting in the work all throughout the match, and **Farshid** with a pretty slick goal and assist.

This week to goes to **Mikey** who managed a few fine saves and was a safe last man. Posts count as part of the keeper too, and they also contributed to keep the Frothers below double digits.

## Dick of the Day
Again, a few good shouts.

- **Oli** calling out Ryan for doing a trivela shot, telling the boys to "Don't do anything fancy" and then cruyff turn into 2 valley players about a min later.
- **James** having a go at the midfield after the match for putting in the work, knowing he will have to back it up in 2 days time.
- **Chris** for playing ball-boy, when he should have just been punting all the balls into the river.

But this week it goes to **Hunter**, sleeping in and missing the 10:30 kick off when the boys would have treasured a sub like a man dying of thirst.

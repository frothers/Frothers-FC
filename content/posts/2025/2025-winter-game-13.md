Three seasons. Three goals. Three all. Three chaos.

On a day that featured more weather changes than a toddlerâ€™s mood, Frothers FC took the field against Blazers, hopeful, hydrated, and heavily benchedâ€”until they werenâ€™t.

Yes, the first half kicked off with a healthy list of subsâ€¦ but those dreams were shattered faster than Chrisâ€™s RSVP response. You see, our beloved organiser-in-chief double-booked himself with a kids party, managing to strip the bench bare by luring half the team into face painting and fairy bread.

## First Half

Despite the off-field betrayal, Frothers started strong. The midfield was a battlefield. Ian laid down a tactical foul so beautiful it should be in the Louvre.

Not to be outdone, Farshid followed up minutes later with his own yellow-worthy tackle, purely out of FOMO.

> 1-0 Frothers

Right before the whistle, a slick passage of play culminated in Oli threading a pass to his mate, who tucked it away. Beautiful stuff. Morale was high. Chris was probably cutting a cake.

## Half-time Tweaks

With Frothers now running on empty and chasing shadows, a halftime tactical change was made. Yarride took up the centre-back mantle (possibly under duress), and the Frothers dug deep. Very deep.

## Second Half

> 1-1 Blazers

Disaster struck when Yarride attempted a clearance that looked more like a hopeful punt to Mars. The ball fell kindly to the Blazers striker who equalised with a tidy finish.

> 2-1 Blazers

The turning point? Hunter, who decided that passing is for peasants, held the ball just long enough to get dispossessed. Blazers pounced, and bangâ€”goal number two.

> 3-1 Blazers

At this point Frothers were defending like their boots were made of jelly. A half-cross, half-shot landed in the box, no one cleared it, and a Blazers header made it three. Ouch.

But Frothers donâ€™t quit. They never quit.

> 3-2 Frothers

A corner was won, and Farshidâ€”desperate to justify his yellow and erase all previous traumaâ€”sprinted to take it like he was chasing a Lotto ticket in the wind.

His corner was whipped in with enough venom to sting, bounced around in chaos, and eventually rebounded out to Oli, who caressed it from outside the box into the net. Suddenly, the comeback was on.

> 3-3 Frothers

Then came the magic. A free kick was awarded just past halfway. Jacob floated a dream of a ball into the box. Evan went up for the header but got rugby tackled by the keeper. The ref (miraculously awake at this point) played advantage.

The ball fell to Farshid, who, in a moment of unexplainable grace, launched himself into a bicycle kick. The connection was sweet. Ronaldo-esque. Champions League vibes. Net bulged. Equaliser. Scenes.

â€¦or it was just an open goal and a tap-in and he scored. Either way, they all count.

## Final Moments

Frothers pushed for a winner, but Mother Nature wasnâ€™t having it. The wind, sun, and sideways rain tag-teamed them into submission.

Final whistle: 3-3. A thriller.

## Man of the Match

 Oli â€“ with a goal, an assist, and battling like Bukayo Saka on six Red Bulls.

## Dick of the Day

Where do we beginâ€¦ After weeks of staying silent over questionable Dick of the Day decisions from few weeks ago, Farshid was finally off the hook.

But stepping up to take the title in spectacular fashion: Chris Chester.

Not only did he skip a crucial match, but he hosted a kidâ€™s party during the game, single-handedly wiping out Frothers' depth like it was a Marvel snap.


See you next week. Unless there's a clown booked. ðŸŽ‰

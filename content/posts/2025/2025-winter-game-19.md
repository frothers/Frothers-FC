## Cup Semi-Final – Wednesday 7pm (aka well past everyone’s bedtime)

It was a frosty Wednesday night, the kind where most Frothers would rather be in pyjamas than football boots. But with a cup final spot on the line, 13 warriors (including several “limited minutes” players who somehow forgot to set their minutes cap) turned up ready for battle.

`Note: There are corrections for this match report`

## First Half

> 1-0 Frothers

Fashionably late, **Lance** arrived looking like he’d just come from a hot date, but within minutes of stepping on the pitch, he buried his first chance. One touch, one goal, and suddenly lateness looked like tactical genius.

`Actually a goal by Yarride with an assist by Lance`

> 2-0 Frothers

**Jacob**, pretending he’s not actually a defender, surged forward and slotted one in to double the lead. Clean finish. Somewhere **Chris** shed a tear at home for missing it.

`Actually an OG with an assist by Jacob`

> 2-1 Vic Uni

Then complacency struck. Frothers thought they were playing FIFA on amateur mode and forgot Vic Uni also had 11 players. A defensive nap later, and it was 2-1. Game on.

> 3-1 Frothers

Before halftime, **Lance** turned provider, slipping a tidy pass into **Farshid**. With all the grace of a man determined to silence his critics, **Farshid** smashed it past the keeper. Frothers went into the break 3-1 up and dreaming of finals football.

## Second Half

Frothers dominated like it was their backyard, controlling possession, creating chances, and playing like the bedtime curfew didn’t exist.

> 4-1 Frothers

Then came the showstopper. A long ball dropped to **Farshid**, who controlled it beautifully and volleyed it into the net with the swagger of Ronaldo and the timing of a Netflix cliffhanger. **Yarride** immediately announced he’d be submitting the goal to the Puskás committee.
(Reality check: probably just goes into the Frothers messenger group archive.)

`Undoubtedly embellished`

The whistle blew at 4-1. Frothers into the cup final, deservedly so, and maybe even awake enough to remember it in the morning.

## Man of the Match
Everyone who bothered showing up on a cold Wednesday night. But officially: **Farshid** – two goals, one highlight reel volley, and still managed to miss a sitter.

## Dick of the Day
Hard to pick… but this one lands on **Chris**. Not for his play, but for not playing—leaving the lads hanging for the semi-final.

The Frothers train keeps a rolling.

Up against a Breathers squad that have also been enjoying a fine start to the season, the Frothers needed to up the ante.

## First Half

The boys stepped up from the kick off and owned the midfield, meaning it felt like there was an overload all around the pitch.

The paid off as a cross from Lance find Jacob who's header was the definition of slow and steady. In off the post in his 50th cap.

> 1-0

Chris almost made it two headers minutes later as a header off an Evan corner hit the crossbar. 

After several good saves from the keeper a spinning ball in the box outran Jacob and the keeper for Oli to tap in.

> 2-0

Frothers football was in full fight. Panicking trying to get the ball out of danger the defender only managed to shank the ball to Oli to get his second. 

> 3-0

## Halftime 

Smelling a Frothers masterclass, Charles Daily appeared. Sneaking in for a cap and a taste of the glory.

The Frothers struggled to make chances count until about the 60 mark, however.

Somehow going without in the first half, Yarride also fancied himself some goals now the wind had died down a little.

Lance plated it up for Yarride to follow in Oli's footsteps and bang it through the keeper. 

> 4-0

A bit of a wane in goals for a few minutes, until Yarride appeared on the ball in the box again to make it 5.

> 5-0

The flood gates were open. Oli dispossed an attacker in the box and successfully ignored the desperate calls from Farshid, who had hit the crossbar direct from a corner minutes earlier, to make it 6.

> 6-0

Ian, after hitting the woodwork himself in the first half, confidently finished off another Lance assist. 

> 7-0

Lance again turned provider with a filthy backheel to Hugo to cap things off.

> 8-0


## Man of the match
A few good options. Oli kicking off his goal scoring with a opportunistic hattrick. Patrick C bossing the midfield. The award this week goes to Finn who had his best game in a Frothers shirt, looking comfortable both on and off the ball.

## Dick of the day 
Equally as many good options. Lance went prime storm trooper by missing a boat load of chances to score himself, most notably heading a ball straight into the keepers head after Evans shot off the bar.

Yarride got denied another goal scoring opportunity by the keeper outside the box, to only receive a yellow, for the second week running... Also rounded the keeper on another occasion to only out run the ball, denying himself a hattrick. Actually, thinking about it, it does go to Yarride.

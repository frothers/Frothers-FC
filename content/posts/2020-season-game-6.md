## Public Enemy- Harder Than You Think

Coming off a disappointing loss the Frother boys took on a second-place Valley FC team without any of their traditional Strikers.

> What, goes, on!

A new false nine formation with Evan as Captain America leading the front line was looking the absolute goods. Frothers were dominating possession and attacking at will down each wing. Harry Furnish broke through and had a curling effort go just wide.

> Check the facts, expose those cats

Time and again the Frothers exposed frailties in their backline, with the killer blow happening when a through-ball from the foot of sweet baby boy Stu Escott cut midfield and backline apart to find his opposite winder, Jamie Hatch. The J man, not falling for the ignore the ball bluff by the defence, tucked the ball deep in the old onion bag.

> Get up  
> Just like that

In a team dripping with defensive prowess, the big hoser himself, Charles Daily, was pushed up into midfield

> It's not in the way you say you care

Half time came about with both the wind and the sun with the Frothers for the second half. This advantage was non-existent however and V Wel got two quick goals.

The Frothers were knocking for the rest of the match but just couldn't get into their groove.

It's back to the drawing board to find the boys best formation, but some strong performances underpin the potential of the team.

Hold the line

**Man of the Match**: Luke for slotting effortlessly into the centre back role, the thinking man's position. There was a noticeable drop in when he was off the pitch.

**Dick of the Day**: Ryan for continuing the proud Frother's tradition of keepers getting injured.

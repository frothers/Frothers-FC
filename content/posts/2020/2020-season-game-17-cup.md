> Best out of three, redemption is calling

# First Half

The first match of the plate and we are straight into the quarter-finals again rivals Sunday Blazers.

The Frothers got off to a flying start, with Lee laying on a nice ball to find **Yarride** who made no mistake.

> 1-0

Not too long afterwards the Frothers doubled the lead. A lovely through-ball by Cole resulted in a classy finish from the big man, **Lee**.

> 2-0

## Couldn't buy a foul

As the half went on the footy started becoming rougher without play being stopped for a whole lot. This stopped when the Blazers won a free kick in a very favourable position. The resulting play produced the loopiest of headers into the far corner of the goal.

> 2-1

Halftime...

# Second Half

The second half produced a few decent chances for both sides. The Blazers took the first advantage of these with a lofted cross in which was finished by the outside of the boot.

> 2-2

The Frothers then fought back with a great roulette in the box by **Colt** which he then finished.

> 3-2

The Blazers then poured on the pressure, and finally got the equaliser. Some slick passing led to a good fake shot and finish.

> 3-3

Full time.

# Penalties

Being a cup format the game went straight to penalties. The Frothers won the toss and it was the **El Capitano** first up.

> Never in doubt. 1-0

The Blazers goalkeeper then stepped up and buried one.

> 1-1

Off the back of his fantastic goal, **Colt** stepped up. But could only put it wide

> 1-1

Seeing the raw power in Ryan's eyes, the Blazers player could only put it over the bar.

> 1-1

Time to get this ship back on course, **Evan** put the mustard on the finish to take the keeper out of the equation.

> 2-1

![](/images/121082564_3186811248211825_6012667961672908520_o.jpg)

The Blazers once again stepped up and cancelled the Frother's lead

> 2-2

Uh oh, in an obvious mix-up **Charles** found himself on the penalty list. Returning to the technique that saw him miss his only other penalty for the Frothers, Charles laced it right over the bar.

> 2-2

Next up the Blazers striker knew it was **Ryan**'s moment. Powerless to stop the force between the sticks he put it right in Ryan's killzone. Like a great white Ryan ate that shit up.

> 2-2

![](/images/121265775_3187421111484172_1942353857843281590_o.jpg)

Mr Goal's **Yarride** stepped up for pen number 5. Not wanting to take any chances he hit a truly class peno.

> 3-2

![](/images/120925068_3186811208211829_2619703011883633997_o.jpg)

Feeling the pure intimidation of such a penalty, the next Blazers penalty taker tried to recreate the brilliance, but could only push it wide

> Frothers win!

## Man of the Match

**Evan** for bossing it out in the middle of the pitch when we needed him most.

## Dick of the Day

Also **Evan**, for sneaking into the beers at halftime under the gise of having no water; stood next to the water fountain...

> Best out of three, redemption is calling

# First Half

The first match of the plate and we are straight into the quarter-finals again rivals Sunday Blazers. 

The lads came hot out the gates with a goal within the first couple of minutes. Lee with a delightful assist to Yarride who buried the opportunity.

> 1-0

Not too long afterwards the Frothers doubled the lead. A lovely through-ball by Cole resulted in a classy finish from the big man, Lee.

> 2-0

## Couldn't buy a foul

As the half went on the footy started becoming rougher without play being stopped for a whole lot. This stopped when the Blazers won a free kick in a very favourable position. The resulting play produced the loopiest of headers into the far corner of the goal.

> 2-1

Halftime...

# Second Half

The second half produced a few decent chances for both sides. The Blazers took the first advantage of these with a lofted cross in which was finished by the outside of the boot.

The Frothers then fought back with a great roulette in the box by Colt which he then finished.

> 3-2

The Blazers then poured on the pressure, and finally got the equaliser. Some slick passing led to a good fake shot and finish.

### Man of the Match

Big **Jack Kos** with the endless energy up top. Very few positions were wasted and lots on incisive running.

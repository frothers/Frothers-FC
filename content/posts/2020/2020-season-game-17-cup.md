> Best out of three

## Redemption is calling

The first match of the plate and we are straight into the quarter-finals again rivals Sunday Blazers. 

The lads came hot out the gates with a goal within the first couple of minutes. Lee with a delightful assist to Yarride who buried the opportunity.

## The return

Big Nick was back from injury, striking the last name from the injury list. Shoulder wrapped up tighter than his pecker at a Taranaki brothel. Taking it easy as to not reinjure himself

## Crack a nut with a sledgehammer

Doing the 'hit it up' strategy, the men up front attempted to press the issue. However, lack of supply meant the attacks were able to be dealt with without troubling the keeper too much.

## Guess who...

The goal for the Frothers eventually came after a glorious chance had just been spurned. Milan putting a ball over the top for Charles to control and pump past the keeper.

### Man of the Match

Big **Jack Kos** with the endless energy up top. Very few positions were wasted and lots on incisive running.

### Dick of the Day

Baby boy **Stu Escott** for ditching the lads last minute to soak up the sun and booze in Marty.

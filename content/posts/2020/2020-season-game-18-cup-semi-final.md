# First half

Looking to put together their first back to back wins of the season the Frothers took on the unknown quantity Edward Street Athletic. The game promised to be a rager.

Boasting a truly girthy squad, the Frothers were able to start a strong first 11 with quality for days off the bench.

The game started in another great fashion for the Frothers, with Stu bringing out his now-classic clearance-cum-threw ball to Yarride. One on one with the keeper Yarride came desperately close, just hitting the upright.

Able to retain a lot more possession, the Frothers were unable to penetrate. Evan, Milan, and the Harrys showed some real desire and composure in the middle to dominate the game. Controlling the game meant the Frothers goal could keep as chased and pure as Charles before he met Lisa.

Getting frustrated at the lack of action they were getting, a player on the Leeds street Baker's decided to take matters into his own hands. In an act of pure overcompensation, the elbows and handbags came out. This was rightly punished with a caution, that he might get a yellow if that continues.

> Enough foreplay

With the game in stalemate, it was time to unleash a secret weapon 57 games in the making. Jamie launched a mystery ball in off a corner. Chris flicked it up on the edge of the box and hit it...

Rocketing in off the crossbar the big cheddar kicked off his account for the Frothers. The lads went into instant ecstasy. Lance, enraptured by the glory of the moment, could only give in to his animal instincts and climb onboard the stallion.

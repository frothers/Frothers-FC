## Change in tactics

Into the Cup/Plate play-off. The Frothers put forward an eyebrow-raising number of changes to the first team, with the big men up top and a Fifa style pace abuse backline.

## The return

Big Nick was back from injury, striking the last name from the injury list. Shoulder wrapped up tighter than his pecker at a Taranaki brothel. Taking it easy as to not reinjure himself

## Crack a nut with a sledgehammer

Doing the 'hit it up' strategy, the men up front attempted to press the issue. However, lack of supply meant the attacks were able to be dealt with without troubling the keeper too much.

## Guess who..

The goal for the Frothers eventually came after a glorious chance had just been spurned. Milan putting a ball over the top for Charles to control and pump past the keeper.

**Man of the Match:**

Big Jack Kos with the endless energy up top. Very few positions were wasted and lots on incisive running.

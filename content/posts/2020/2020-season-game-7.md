The next game for the Frothers was at the illustrious St. Pats turf, with a dirty old face showing up on the bench.

In a game full of goals, with a new set of faces on the scoresheet it was another ultimately disappointing result with a 93rd-minute equaliser to the Unicorns after an _orgasmic_ late goal to the Frothers.

**Man of the Match:**

A stellar midfield performance resulting in a goal from the beast from the eastern block, Milan.

**Dick of the Day:**

A 93rd minute attempted nutmeg which resulted in a turnover and late equaliser was enough to bank the DotD award for the sundance kid, Evan.

After months of delays due to COVID19, the Frother boys finally got out onto the field.

**Man of the Match:** 

Sam - a stella performance for his first run out with the frothers

**Dick Of the Day:**

Chris - For rolling up 20 mins before the game with everyone's kits and balls.

Kitted out with new threads and new squad members.

A game of few chances, big Harry had an effort destined for the top corner plucked from the air.

The big positive to take from the match was the structure and solidity of the backline. With the help of some old faces and some new blood.

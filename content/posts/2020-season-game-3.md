Another rough day at the office for the frother boys. After a very promising first 30 at which it was 1-1 the goals started coming, and they don't stop coming.

Beautiful to see the big rig from Norwich back amount the lads and the goals. We'll make an honest man out of you one day Lee Greengrass.

**Man of the Match**

The big man with the left of gold Chris Chester. Playing some many balls to feet that I'm sure Fulli Furnish is shedding a tear somewhere.

**Dick of the Day**

Has to be our man Charles Daily. For megging a guy and then falling flat on his face for the icing on the cake.

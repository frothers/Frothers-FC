On an unlikely, beautifully still Wellington afternoon at the Te football turf under some half-ass flood lights Frothers FC stepped out onto the pitch. In a league where underdogs triumph over favorites and surprises lurk at every corner, you can never judge the opposition solely by their position on the league table and Frothers FC did not.

Initially, the Penny Traders seemed like a decent team, but as soon as a foot was set in their half, magic happened. A flurry of slick passes, culminated in a Shandy cross with Jarrod's sexy touch and fantastic finish to open the scoring. From there, a goal-scoring rampage ensued, hitting the back of the net multiple times in quick succession.

Farshid went on a furious run down the wing, lofting a perfect ball over the defense to Yash, who initially looked like he fluffed it but skillfully recovered and hammered the ball at the keeper forcing a save and a rebound that Aaron put away with quite the composure. Another combination of Farshid's sublime cross and Yash's determination to put his head on the ball was a sight to behold for goal number three. And they weren't done yet. 

With some work down the left wing Jarrod dropped the ball in front of Lance who threw a step over at the defender to slip past and put away the fourth goal. Set pieces have proven to be deadly for the Frothers this season and a lovely crossed ball arrived at Jarrod's head and into the mixer for Shandy to tumble home despite useless cries for a foul.

The Penny Traders found themselves plagued by injuries, including one poor lad who did a number on his leg. Despite Ian's protestations of not touching the player, the laws of physics said otherwise and the player was brought down for a free kick. The game was brought to a halt for a forever-coming ambulance for the player who was eventually ferried off to the hospital in a car. Thanks Public Health spending. The Penny Traders had to call in ex-Habbibis mercenary reinforcements who were sitting like vultures on the sideline, waiting for a game. 

As the second half kicked off, the goal frenzy took a break, but the opportunities didn't with Jarrod almost hitting the net on a couple of occasions; the opposition keeper also making some great saves. While the Frothers may have eased off the gas pedal in the second half, leaving ample space on the field and squandering a few opportunities, it doesn't diminish the sheer magnificence of the resounding and emphatic victory.  

On a momentous note, Yarride reached a monumental milestone, playing his 100th game for the club. A feat achieved by only a few, despite not officially being part of the squad this year, which seems suspicious. Nevertheless, it's a testament to his dedication and passion for the game as one of the 2017 founders of the club. 

Yash clinched the dubious honor of the "Dick of the Day" award, thanks to the world's worst yellow card, while the rest of the team put in some hard work, with forwards playing out of position in midfield. Farshid showed up with a great offensive and defense display (despite that "clean" tackle) while Ryan literally put is face on the line to keep that clean sheet. However, that competition was batted away by Jarrod for the MotM award; getting himself into the right places, creating opportunities, working hard upfront as well as the middle and capping it all off with a goal and two assists. Stellar stuff.

Frothers FC delivering an absolute stunner, crushing the Marist Penny Traders with a spectacular 5-0 victory continued their fine form for the season. And as the sun set on that unlikely, beautifully still Wellington afternoon, a beaming Evan Hansen, watching from the sidelines, gave his stamp of approval, enviously wishing away his injury and hailing it as one of our team's finest performances of the season.

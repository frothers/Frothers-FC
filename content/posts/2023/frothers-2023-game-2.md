The second grading game, this time against newcomers Chicken

Bit of a lineup change up, with the midfielders getting lazy for kickoff timing.

The game kicked off at a good pace, with the boys bearing down on goals almost immediately. It didn't take long until **Jarrod**, back from what I can only assume was another pacific island holiday, scored the first and only goal. After some good work by **Lance**, **Jarrod** had his initial shot saved but he was quick onto the follow up.

> 1-0

The Frothers could have easily been up by another couple as all 3 scorers from last week, **Aaron**, **Lance**' and **Josh**, managed to hit the bar.

The game became more of a battle of the shit chat than a competition as the wind increased and **Charles** found his Bash Brother in the form of **Farshid**. **Charles** also managed to pick up a yellow card for his troubles.

## Man of the Match
Backing up the chat, **Farshid** had a great game in the backline. Great organisation, talking, passing, and a healthy helping of getting away with dribbling his way out of trouble.

## Dick of the Day
Proof that the shithouse life burns you as much as it pays off, **Charles Dailey** gets the award for getting a yellow and putting the ref on high alert. Honourable mention is **Evan Hansen** with another injury...

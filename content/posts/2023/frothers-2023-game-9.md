## First Half

## Halftime

## Man of the Match

**Milan**'s dad for bringing beer and watching the game in cold. Then having to pretend to like Djokovic.

## Dick of the Day

Fresh to the team, but already trying to forge a legacy, **Farshid** picks up his first of DotD. A missed header followed by an attempted and failed handball. This feels like the beginning of something special.

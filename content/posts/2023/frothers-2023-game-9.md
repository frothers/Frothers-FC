An earlier kick-off and the return of the **Evans**. The boys were up against a familiar opponent in LBQ and looking at cementing their position in the champions league spots. The photographer even came.

## First Half

The Frothers took control of the game from the start, but were unable to find much flow going forwards. The midfield was being packed by both teams and decent possession was hard to come by.

It was time for the Frothers to wind back the clock and go for some classic route 1 football. With the LBQ Midfield all packed together **Lance** was able to run past the defence and be fed by **Chris** from deep. With an seeming eternity to pick his spot **Lance** was able to keep his hot form going.

> 1-0

Not to be outdone, **Aaron** moved level again with **Lance** as top scorer. After some great work to dispossess the opposition midfielder, it was **Lance** himself who played **Aaron** in.

> 2-0

## Halftime

The LBQ boys rung some changes and a couple of the old hands came into the game. The Frothers struggled to recapture their momentum and it was all LBQ for the start of the second half.

LBQ finally made the pressure tell and were able to string some good passing together, with the striker taking a composed touch and finish to get LBQ back in the game.

> 2-1

A hold-up in play happended not long after as **Evan H** went down again for what must be double didgets this season. The glassman grim reeper is surely circling.

The boys were able to hang-on for the rest of the match for a hard fought victory, moving them to second on the table!

## Man of the Match

**Lance** with the goal, assist, and just being a huge pest to the opposition.

## Dick of the Day

**Shand** tried to take the bullet for him, but it has to go to my man **Charles**. Receiving possession in a dangerous position, **Charles** attempted the old-head move of just booting it into an opposition player for a throw, but managed to just toe poke it into touch.

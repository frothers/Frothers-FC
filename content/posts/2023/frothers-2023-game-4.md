The Frothers confirmed their coronation to the Division of Kings for season 2023 on Sunday with a fourth straight grading win. On a weekend when Colonialism took the headlines, The Royal Purple and Golds were never going to cease power to a team calling themselves the Lazy 11.

Half the commonwealth worked together to get the Frothers ahead in a dominant first half. A sexy back heel from India (**Yash**) to Canada (**Charles**) started a flowing team move superbly finished off by New Zealand (**Jarrod**), before South Africa (**Lance**) doubled the lead with his own classy one on one. England (**Ian**) was, of course, the glue holding it all together with yet another commanding performance from RB.

Naturally, USA (**Evan**) had to then take over and go it alone. First, complaining about a bad pass that wasn’t intended for him in the first place, then ignoring open guys around him as he flicked the ball to himself and scored with a stunning volley from outside the box. Fantastic footballer, great team guy and a wonderful dude, maybe **Evan** is Making America Great Again.
> 3-0 at half time.

Obviously it wouldn’t be a royal family celebration without a bit of beef between brothers. **Yash** was fuming after being called offside when through on goal, despite starting his run in his own half. Some say they saw **Yarride** himself appealing to the ref to make the call. A wound he rubbed salt into 2 minutes later when scoring off his own well placed throughball.

After going 260 minutes without conceding The Frothers then let 3 in in 10 minutes to set up a finish as nervy as Prince Andrew in a courtroom. Some expert time wasting in the corner however saw the boys safely through to yet another win. 4-3 it finished and with 8 goals in 2 games, the Frothers attack is coming together nicely for what is hopefully a long reign at the top.

## Man of the Match
The commonwealth will be asking Serbia to join after todays performance by **Milan Mrdalj**. Slotting in seamlessly in the midfield as well as both full back roles, **Milan** was crucial in attack and defence. A couple killer through balls giving him a pair of assists that Nikola Jokic would have been proud of. Sorry for the photo.

## Dick of the Day
**Chris Chester** for bringing some bad vibes down and seeing a 4-0 lead cut to 1 in the 15 minutes he was present. Further cementing the award, he then threw the blame at The Frothers own beloved 74 year old **King Charles**.

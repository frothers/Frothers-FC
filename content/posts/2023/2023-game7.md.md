Back in the purple and under the lights. The Frothers were out well past bedtime against more mullets and mos than a XXXX tent at a beer festival.

## First Half

The Camaradas came out strong in the first half and controlled the game. Though not having too many good oportunites, with the Frothers unable to hold on to possesion the Camaradas were able to finally make the pressure count, forcing two errors from the Frother's backline.

> 0-2

The Frother's best opportunities came from letting the opposition defence have enough rope to hang themselves. But nothing else came from the first half.

## Halftime

A change of tactics was needed and Frothers captain **Chris** could be seen sneaking away to do some improvements to the match balls...

Soon into the second half **Aaron** was able to catch a cocky RB off balance and able to hit dipping volley on the turn just over the keeper's reach.

> 1-2

The Camaradas managed to pick themselves up and find aother two goals from well constructed attacks.

> 1-4

The Frothers weren't done, though. A well placed corner from **Evan** forced an error out of the keeper that feel kindly to **Lance's** feet 1 metre out from goal. Shooting with his back to goal and through the men.

> 2-4

The boys were on a roll and some beautiful play followed with **Yash** and **Evan** linking up before delivering a perfect low cross for **Aaron** to stride on to and finish confidently to get his second.

> 3-4

Sadly that was the end of the dream, as Camaradas waited approximate 3 seconds to score.

## Man of the match

Dual award this week as both **Aaron** and **Evan** did very well to contribute to the Frothers' goals, and kept going throughout the game.

## Dick of the Day

Losing the Frothers best matchball before the match is a surefire way to book your spot in DoTD. **Milan** is making his name as the most mercurial Frother.

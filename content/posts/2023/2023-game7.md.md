Back in the purple and under the lights. The Frothers were out well past bedtime against more mullets and mos than a XXXX tent at a beer festival.

## First Half

The Camaradas came out strong in the first half and controlled the game. Though not having too many good oportunites, with the Frothers unable to hold on to possesion the Camaradas were able to finally make the pressure count, forcing two errors from the Frother's backline.

> 0-2

The Frother's best opportunities came from letting the opposition defence have enough rope to hang themselves. But nothing else came from the first half.

## Halftime

A change of tactics was needed and Frothers captain **Chris** could be seen sneaking away to do some improvements to the match balls...

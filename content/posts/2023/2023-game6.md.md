## First Half

The Frothers almost started the game a man down as no-one really realised **Jarrod** wasn't there till kick-off. The first half was tight, with both **Lance** and **Aaron** having good shots saved. The first goal came to Mark Ave however, after a relentless assault down the Frother's right wing resulted in a ball falling perfectly between 3 Frothers and allowing the Mark Ave player to make the most of the indecision.

> 0-1

Trying to regroup the Frothers suffered from an unforced error under a highball to allow the Mark Ave striker through on goal for their second.

> 0-2, the most dangerous lead

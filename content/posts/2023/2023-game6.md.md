## First Half

The Frothers almost started the game a man down as no-one really realised **Jarrod** wasn't there till kick-off. The first half was tight, with both **Lance** and **Aaron** having good shots saved. The first goal came to Mark Ave however, after a relentless assault down the Frother's right wing resulted in a ball falling perfectly between 3 Frothers and allowing the Mark Ave player to make the most of the indecision.

> 0-1

Trying to regroup the Frothers suffered from an unforced error from your Baby Boy **Chris **under a highball to allow the Mark Ave striker through on goal for their second.

> 0-2, the most dangerous lead

\~~Redemption~~ ~~Justice~~ 

The Frothers earned a freekick just inside the opponents half and up stepped up **Chris** for an obligatory long range freekick. Just like the big man, Ronnie, I get one to rewrite history every so often.

## Halftime

The boys knew that they were due something out of this match and it didn't take long to get back into it.

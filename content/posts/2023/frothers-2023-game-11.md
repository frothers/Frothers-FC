On a rainy day at Ascot Park in Porirua, with the absence of  some key players, Frothers FC took to the field for their game. The weather conditions added an extra challenge to the match, with the rain making the pitch wet and potentially affecting the gameplay. Despite the unfavourable weather, both teams battled it out in an attempt to secure a victory.


The first half of the game was tightly contested, with both teams battling it out in the rain-soaked conditions.

In the midst of the chaos, **Ryan** managed to earn himself a yellow card not for a foul, but for expressing his frustration towards the referee on a handball incident. Clear handball, should have been a yellow card to the Mark ave player.

In a twist of fate, Mark Ave, the team that sounds like a street name, had their moment of glory in the rain-soaked chaos. Despite the slippery conditions, they managed to orchestrate a series of one-twos that left the Frother's defence doing a wet and wild dance routine. The ball, slicker than a banana peel on an ice rink, took an unexpected detour off **Ryan**'s hand and slid its way past the goalkeeper, who was left flailing like a penguin on roller skates. It was a comical goal that even had the raindrops chuckling as they fell from the sky. 

> 1-0

The entertainment continued in the second half when the opposing team's frustration got the best of them. One of their players, caught up in the waterlogged madness, let out a verbal tirade that would have made even the most seasoned insult comedians blush. The referee had no choice but to hand out a red card, leaving the poor player to swim back to the dressing room.


Amidst the downpour, Frothers FC's **Farshid** pulled off a tackle so clean it could rival the squeaky-clean reputation of a freshly laundered jersey. Unfortunately, the referee seemed to have misplaced his spectacles and saw it as an offence deserving of a yellow card. Later, **Farshid** experienced what can only be described as a waterlogged axe attack from an opponent, yet somehow, the ref was too busy admiring his own reflection on his whistle to notice.

In a truly bizarre turn of events, **Farshid** received a red card for daring to question the referee about the weather conditions. Perhaps the ref was convinced that he alone had the exclusive rights to meteorological discourse on the pitch.

Despite the aquatic antics, the opposing team managed to capitalise on a corner kick, finding the back of the net. But Frothers FC, undeterred by the rain or the referee's perplexing decisions, continued to control the game. They created numerous chances and even had a few free kicks. Where was “bend like Lance” when we needed it.

> 0-2


In the end, Frothers FC may not have secured the victory, but they certainly earned themselves a standing ovation for turning a rainy day game into a sidesplitting aquatic spectacle. 


## Dick of the day

In the race for the prestigious "Dick of the Day" award, **Farshid**'s unjustified double yellow cards couldn't secure the title, but it was **Charles** who triumphed in the most absurd fashion. During the post-match press conference, he passionately argued that Barbie movies would outshine Oppenheimer, saying “he made a bomb, so what”. The room fell into a bewildered silence until Ian hilariously questioned **Charles**'s bomb-making experience. 

## Man of the Match

Despite the rain pouring like cats and dogs and facing opponents as fierce as a pack of hungry lions, **Aaron** rose above it all like a majestic unicorn in rain boots and delivered a performance that left everyone in awe. With each move, he defied the laws of gravity, making it seem like he had an invisible trampoline hidden beneath his boots. His stellar display earned him the coveted "Man of the Match" title, proving that even in the midst of wet chaos, unicorns can still reign supreme on the football field.

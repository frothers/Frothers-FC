Two weeks off, a king's birthday, a Man City treble and another 7 pm game to ruin any changes of being well rested for the beginning of the working week.

Playing Pelicans team that the Frothers last met in the Semifinal of the plate last season. On that day the Frothers won 5-3, turning around a 3-1 halftime scoreline (and a **Milan** red card).

## First Half

A slick night at Wakefield and the rust was clearly showing for the Frothers. Finding it hard to get a rhythm against a new look Pelicans team with some new tactics.

An unusually quiet Frothers were undone by their own communications, and **Jamie B** passed the ball perfectly between his back line for the Pelicans player to run onto and poke past **Ryan**.

> 0-1

## Halftime

A bit of an inquisition on the side line followed by some opposition player trash talking **Jacob**, obviously a jilted opponent from the mean streets of indoor basketball.

> Looks like I've found a sport I can beat you at.

The Frothers were a different team in the second half, moving the wall around nicely to expose the centre heavy Pelicans.

It wasn't longer before a generously hit through-ball by Chris was chased all the way to the by-line by Aaron, who then beat the defender chasing him and dispatched the finish from an obscene angle.

> 1-1

The momentum had truly shifted, and minutes later some fine work by Shand resulted in **Yash** seizing on a mistake by the defender to poke home his first goal for the Frothers.

> 2-1

Some excellent work in midfield by **Lance** resulted in a through-ball to **Jarrod** that was dispatched off the left with aplomb.

> 3-1

Not to miss out, **Shand** received the ball on the edge on the box and placed a powerful shot past the keeper to secure the turnaround.

> 4-1

The last real piece of action of the match was when **Ryan** saved a late 1-on-1 to keep the second half firmly as Frothers' time.

## Man of the Match

**Milan**'s dad for bringing beer and watching the game in cold. Then having to pretend to like Djokovic.

## Dick of the Day

Fresh to the team, but already trying to forge a legacy, **Farshid** picks up his first of DotD. A missed header followed by an attempted and failed handball. This feels like the beginning of something special.

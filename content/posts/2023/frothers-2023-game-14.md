Out as Ascot part vs Purple Reign.

## First Half

A new look Frothers XI this week which must have been repping an average age in the mid thirties. **Salty **was enticed out of physio's pocket and **Ryan M** had his first game for the Frothers after some time on the sideline with an ACL.

It didn't take long until the cry of a reawakened injury cut through the air with **Ryan M **getting caught by a challenge in the air. It was going to be a long day with no subs.

The Frothers were well in the match, however, and even opened the scoring as **Lance** was able to take on a man and finish a shot off the left foot into the bottom corner.

> 1-0

A hard fought half looked like the Frothers would go into halftime in the lead, however a deflected shot following a corner left **Kindle** for dead.

> 1-1

## Halftime

The Frothers were well in it, but were quickly running out of energy.

Purple Reign were able to take the lead as their player was able to glide into the box almost unchallenged and hit it to the keeper's right.

> 1-2

As the half dragged on the fatigue really set in an large spaces started to open up.

## Man of the Match

**Ian** gets a back to back man of the match. Doing heaps of running up the wing is only bettered by bringing enough beers for the boys to really get stuck in afterwards.

## Dick of the Day

Anyone that didn't show. One sub would have been the difference.

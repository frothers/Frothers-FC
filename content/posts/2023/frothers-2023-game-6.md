## First Half

The Frothers almost started the game a man down as no one really realised **Jarrod** wasn't there till kick-off. The first half was tight, with both **Lance** and **Aaron** having good shots saved. The first goal came to Mark Ave however, after a relentless assault down the Frother's right wing resulted in a ball falling perfectly between 3 Frothers and allowing the Mark Ave player to make the most of the indecision.

> 0-1

Trying to regroup the Frothers suffered from an unforced error from your Baby Boy **Chris** under a highball to allow the Mark Ave striker through on goal for their second.

> 0-2, the most dangerous lead

~~Redemption~~ ~~Justice~~

The Frothers earned a freekick just inside the opponent's half and up stepped up **Chris** for an obligatory long-range freekick, courtesy of **Charles** supposedly. Just like the big man, Ronnie, I get one every so often that doesn't go into low orbit.

> 1-2

## Halftime

The boys knew that they were due something out of this match and it didn't take long to get back into it.

First, it was **Jacob**, played in by some good play from **Jamie**, and shooting the into the corner to level it up.

> 2-2

Next was **Lance** who continued his great form this season to get the Frothers into the lead for the first time in the match.

> 3-2

The Frothers couldn't hold on however, and Mark Ave we able to find an equaliser late in the game.

> 3-3

## Man of the Match

Finding his new calling down the left, **Milan** had a great game. Other nominations included **Evan Doube** who did some great hold-up play up top.

## Dick of the Day

A couple of contenders, but this week it goes to **Jarrod** for missing the kick-off, the one week we are organised with the starting lineup. **Chris** almost snuck in by picking up a dirty yellow card for kicking the ball way. Better to leave it to **Charles** and **Farshid**.

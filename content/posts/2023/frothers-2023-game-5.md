Nothing says happy mothers' day than a delayed late game for the parents of young kids. Coming off the back of 4 wins, the Frothers were up against their most difficult opponent yet, the Blazers.

A Frothers team were more rolled ankles than shoulder rubs, with a few question marks over fitness. Not the case for **Evan H** though, who was throwing Kung Fu kicks all over the park.

## First Half

The first showed why the Frothers have been such a powerhouse this season. Working as a unit and treating others the way we would want to be treated. This was undermined by a decision as unfair as the younger sibling being able to have a TV in their room. A deflected handball against **Jacob** who couldn't do any more to get his hands out of the way.

The penalty was converted by Frother at heart, Tyler.

> 0-1

The boys knew that this game had opportunities for them and didn't have to wait too long to get their chance. 2 weeks without a game meant **Chris** was hungry, and like Friday Fish and Chips, he wasn't waiting for others to get into the communal chips. Reacting first to a spilled corner, headed home to level the game.

> 1-1

## Halftime

The second half proved to be a different beast. The Frothers showed the same composure as the first time getting in the cookie jar. Dropping 4 goals in no time.
A bit of a consolation goal with **Aaron** doing well to turn his man in the box and blasting in a shot.

> 2-7

## Man of the Match

**Chris** with a defensive display that was like mother's milk and a goal to top it off. It's good to be back.

## Dick of the Day

**Jacob** for a handball that lead to a penalty, another one that was waved away more out of sympathy than merit, and finally risking future grandchildren by copping a strong hit to the groin.

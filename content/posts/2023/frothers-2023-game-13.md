The Frothers had an immediate shot at redemption, facing a LBQ team that soundly beat them last week.

The Frothers love a cup and were going for a 4th straight finals appearance this season.

## First Half

The Frothers immediately set-up in a lot more solidly than last week and were able to easily quash any LBQ attacks.

LBQ were packing the midfield again so the Frothers had to resort to other tactics to get opportunities. A clearance come through-ball from Chris found Jarrod on the edge of the box. Jarrod was able to beat his man to it and cut inside and finish at the near post.

> 1-0

Not long after the boys tried around rather than over. Aaron saw Yash breaking free and sent an early through-ball that Yash decided to hit first time with the toe to completely bamboozle the keeper.

> 2-0

## Halftime

LBQ decided to go with a different tactic in the second half now that they had the wind, bombing everyone up the middle.

This paid dividends after 20 minutes as a ball bobbled through into the box and through the use of a well timed headlock the LBQ striker was able to get on the end of it.

> 2-1 

This goal was just what LBQ needed to 

## Man of the Match

Evan Doube gets the nod this week. In a match where the football was a bit off Evan showed the heart, heading a highball right on the money maker. After sporting a bloody nose at half-time some toilet paper and froth got Doube back on soon after in the second half.

## Dick of the Day

Not this week

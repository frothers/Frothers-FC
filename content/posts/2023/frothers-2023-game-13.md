The Frothers had an immediate shot at redemption, facing a LBQ team that soundly beat them last week.

The Frothers love a cup and were going for a 4th straight finals appearance this season.

## First Half

The Frothers immediately set-up in a lot more solidly than last week and were able to easily quash any LBQ attacks. **Doube** did manage to pick himself up a classy yellow got a good old fashioned ball-or-man chop.

LBQ were packing the midfield again so the Frothers had to resort to other tactics to get opportunities. A clearance come through-ball from **Chris** found **Jarrod** on the edge of the box. **Jarrod** was able to beat his man to it and cut inside and finish at the near post, on his 50th appearance no less.

> 1-0

Not long after the boys tried around rather than over. **Aaron** saw **Yash** breaking free and sent an early through-ball that **Yash** decided to hit first time with the toe to completely bamboozle the keeper.

> 2-0

## Halftime

LBQ decided to go with a different tactic in the second half now that they had the wind, bombing everyone up the middle.

This paid dividends after 20 minutes as a ball bobbled through into the box and through the use of a well timed headlock the LBQ striker was able to get on the end of it.

> 2-1

This goal was just what LBQ needed to start the bullshit train. A miss-hit potshot somehow floated into the top corner to level things up.

> 2-2

Adding a bit on injury to insult LBQ were able to press-on and grab the lead by following through on a challenge on Ryan to allow the ball to fall to an LBQ player with an open net.

> 2-3

Pushing everyone up the Frothers were it on the break to settle things

> 2-4

## Man of the Match

**Ian** had a huge game down the right on both attack and defence. LBQ needed to resort to the dark arts to finally get by him.

## Dick of the Day

Everyone who fluffed a back-heel, which was everybody who tried one. Special mention goes to **Evan Hanson** who gave **Yash** as dressing down for being wasteful, only to then do the exact same thing 5 mins later.

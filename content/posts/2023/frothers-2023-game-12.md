The winter weather had properly set in as the Frothers too on LBQ again at Wellington College. The Frothers had to wait until just before kickoff to get a full XI and the Frothers took this hunger into the match.

LBQ weren't letting the rain slow them down and got straight into the match. After about ten minutes they made hay down the wing and had a low cross parried directly to one of their player's feet.

> 0-1

After another 10 minutes the Frothers still couldn't find any rhythm and LBQ were able to take advantage and get a second quite soft goal.

> 0-2

Feeling they had the football gods on their side, LBQ were able to start stringing together some outrageous stuff. First a backheel flick off a cross for the third.

> 0-3

Then a volley from a freekick.

> 0-4

## Halftime

Ian and  Farshid had had enough and left to go watch the Sweden women's team, purely as research I'm sure.

The second-half was a bit of a wash, with neither team really having any great chances.

## Man of the Match

Evan Doube gets the nod this week. In a match where the football was a bit off Evan showed the heart, heading a highball right on the money maker. After sporting a bloody nose at half-time some toilet paper and froth got Doube back on soon after in the second half.

## Dick of the Day

Not this week

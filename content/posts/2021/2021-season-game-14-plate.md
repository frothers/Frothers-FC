> This one goes out to the lovers

The Frothers looked to keep their unbeaten cup form alive in the first round, and quarterfinals, of the WSFLplate.

A still night at Wellington college under a full moon made for a perfect date, with only the high ball under the lights causing any real red flags.

The game wasn't long gone before the Fire Starters nearly ruined the evening, however. A great save by **Ryan** and then the knight in shining armour, **Alex**, came in with a goal-line clearance.

Realising this wasn't going to be a sure thing the Frothers immediately struck back and **Yarride** was put through on goal by an **Evan** header. They don't call him _the one that got away_ for nothing.

> 1-0

# Halftime

Going into the break 1 up the Frothers knew they needed a second against a well-organised Fireraisers. They needed the kiss of death.

It didn't take long for the Frothers to lean in. **Charles** started the move with a pass to **Yarride** who then sent it to **Jamie**. Not one to wait until the 3rd date, Jamie sent it home.

> 2-0

Floating on cloud 9 after the two-goal lead, the Frothers knew that love was in the air. **Lance** this time serenaded the home fans with a twisting and turning tango in the box to then square it to **Harry** who let is body ride the wave of passion.

> 3-0

It was never a night for clean sheets. After not having a proper opportunity in the second half a Fireraiders player was brought down on the edge on the edge of the box. A free-kick was put into the top corner of the goal, with a little help from a flakey wall and a crowded keeper.

> 3-1

But that was all they could muster, and the Frothers were through to the Semis to play Super Patties Fun Club.

## Man of the Match

Another great team game, **football** was the winner on the day_._

## Dick of the Day

**Jamie** for ducking out of the wall to allow for the goal. A selfish grab for fantasy point supremacy, having already bagged a goal.

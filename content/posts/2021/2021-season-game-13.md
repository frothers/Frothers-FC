Missing 5 or 6 key players from this season, Frothers game against Habibis this weekend gave other players the chance to step up and shine on Matariki weekend. An even start to the game was not reflected on the scoreboard as Frothers spurned a few good chances while Habibis took all of theirs to quickly race out to a 3-0 lead.

> 0-3

Needing a change in momentum, Evanâ€™s introduction from the bench had an immediate impact. His corner was cleared only as far as **Alex** on the edge of the box whose low shot took a deflection before sneaking in the bottom corner.

> 1-3

**Evan** then turned goalscorer, good link-up play with Lance leading to a fine left-footed finish from the American at the near post.

> 2-3

## Halftime

3-2 at halftime had the Frothers up for a big second half and they soon levelled the score with **Jarrod** running on to a through ball from Nick before powering a strong finish past the keeper.

> 3-3

Confidence was surging through the Frothers play now and they made it count with **Lance** and **Cole** both scoring from good build-up play to make it 5-3 to the Frothers.

> 5-3

And that was how it ended. Except that the Habibis started getting fired up, using their bodies to put pressure on the defence and their mouths to put pressure on the ref. 1 goal started the comeback before a second tied it up and finally, a third game gave Habibis the win with less than 5 minutes to go.

> 5-6

Despite the loss, Frothers play magnificently and also did extremely well to hold their calm in the face of a verbal onslaught and rather unsporting behaviour from the opposition. One final league match against the old foe, Blazers before what is hopefully a successful cup run.

## Man of the Match

**Jarrod** for his most effective display in a Frothers shirt, running hard all day and scoring his first goal for the club. **Nick**, **Jack** and **Alex** also stepped up to have their best games of the season meaning the absence of Charles, Chris and Sule were hardly noticed.

## Dick of the Day

**Nick**, despite a fantastic performance stepping up at centre back, the cheek to suggest Chris will be getting dropped for next week after conceding 6 goals has Nick picking up this award.

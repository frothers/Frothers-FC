Liverpool making the Top 4 last week despite having their midfield and defence ravaged through injury had Frothers dreaming of success against North Wellington with 8 players unavailable.

In less than ideal conditions at Ascot Park, the first half indicated a close battle would ensue. North Wellington took the lead through a top-corner screamer but Frothers kept it tight and with a slight change in formation they started to create chances of their own. Minutes before halftime, Yarride went down with a pulled hamstring and the short-handed Frothers were down to 10 men.

The second half started brightly with Sule forcing an error from their defender before putting a very tidy finish off the far upright to level it at 1-1. A short time later North Wellington replied with a nice goal of their own before the flood gates opened in more ways than 1 as North Wellington ran away with it in torrential rain. On a tough day for Ryan in goal, 3 late goals blew it out to 5-1 before the referee mercifully blew for full time.

Lance and Evan were fantastic in midfield running all day to keep us in the game. Charles and Sule filling in CB were key to keeping us in the game for the first 60minutes. The 2 fullbacks, Sam and Will also stood out the Frothers on a bad day for the club.

Hopefully, next week brings better weather and a return to full strength for the Frothers.

> The rematch

Replaying the earlier fixture in the season where the Frothers won 2-1 the game was again under lights at Te Whaea.

The game started quite evenly balanced, with the Frothers able to make more with their final ball.

## Loves a screamer

The breakthrough came when **Lance** let fly a perfectly weighted shot into the top corner that the keeper could only watch.

This came off the back of a nice play that culminated with **Charles** finding **Lance** on the edge of the area. The danger looks to have gone when Lance took a bit of a rough touch, but he turned and shot it, catching the keeper out.

> 1-0

# Half time

The Frothers came into the break 1-0 up, but the next half was into the wind, and uphill...

Valley FC came out the stronger of the two sides in the second half but was still missing a killer edge as their plays couldn't break through the backline.

## Just float it in

The leveller came from a free-kick quite far out. The Valley player lofted it into the wind and the ball ended up drifting in at the back-post after the bounce. One to forget.

> 1-1

## Ghosts in at the back

Valley then got themselves into the lead when a ball in from the left found an unmarked man at the back post. The player was able to calmly finish to put Valley into the lead.

> 1-2

## Able to hold on

Though the Frothers started upping the pressure they couldn't quite manage to get the breakthrough. **Yarride** had a great looking shot blacked by a valley defender.

The last telling moment was when **Milan** brought down a Valley player comfortably in the box. The ref then pointed to a freekick outside the box, causing a bit of anger...

# Man of the Match

**Angus** had a great game at the back and did everything he could to keep the opposition out.

The big derby to finish the season off, with the Frothers fighting for a bit of pride and to get away from the bottom of the table.

It was a wet and windy day at Te Whaea with the game almost getting off to a wild start, with **Lance** getting caught in the face with a clearance and the rebound ending up as a decent shot on target.

The Blazers took the lead as a player ghosted in at the back post on a corner and headed home.

> 0-1

Pushing for the equaliser, the Frothers came close many times but couldn't quite find the back of the net.

It was the Blazers who scored next, however. A ball over the top from the ever-dangerous Alain led to the Blazers striker scoring from a tight angle.

> 0-2

Desperate to get back in the game, the Frothers were awarded a freekick just inside the opposition half. With it being wet and windy **Chris** fancied a tipple. Hitting a hard dipping shot that the keeper could only get fingertips to.

> 1-2

The Blazers kept their pressure up, managing to get a few shots from outside of the box. One of these shots could only be parried and the chasing in Blazers player got there first.

> 1-3

## Halftime

Wit the Blazers going into the changing room for halftime the Frothers stood their ground in the wet. They merely adopted Wellington as a home, we were born in it, moulded by it.

Seeing the success the Blazers had with following in shots, **Jarrod** followed in an effort and was able to put his shot between the keeper's legs.

> 2-3

The Frothers started to get plenty of freedom behind the Blazers defence as they tried to maintain a high line. This time **Lance** was in and able to beat the keeper to the ball. The comeback is on.

> 3-3

Rallying, the Blazers were able to mount another successful attack, with their unmarked striker able to tuck home a first time finish in the box.

> 3-4

Not to be disheartened, the Frothers doubled their efforts. It was **Lance** again who levelled things up with some great interplay with **Evan**.

> 4-4

Determined for the win, the Frothers continued to put the pressure on. Running through on goal the keeper was rounded only to have **Jamie's** effort cleared off the line. **Yarride** was there to take it down, nutmeg the keeper, and finish the game for the Frothers!

> 5-4

## Man of the Match

The whole team put in a mammoth effort and it is hard to pick one player. **Jack** gets the nod for playing his second game in a row injury-free and doing some great defensive work.

## Dick of the Day

**Jarrod** for when the game was at 4-4 throwing his toys and leaving the ball on the line when we weren't awarded the corner, killing time when we were pushing for a winner.

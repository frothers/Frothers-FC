# The 40-year-old Virgin

This week's game was preceded by the birthday of our favourite Canadian. **Charles '_sweet cherry'_ Daily  
**

Playing against a North Wellington side that had put the Frothers to the sword the last couple of times we played. As the saying goes it gets harder the longer you wait. In an attempt to crack this nut we brought the 12th man will a stacked sideline of supporters.  
  
The first half was all about quality football winning out. The Frothers let the ball do the talking and had several nice plays going from front to back. In contrast, North Wellington were unable to get anything going past halfway due to an absolute shift being put in by the centre mids.  
  
The breakthrough came with another back to front move, with Evan picking up the ball in a good shooting position on the edge of the box. Cutting a disguised pass into the box Lance ran onto it and fired it into the back of the net.  
  
After a bit of back and forth, North Wellington got a golden chance. A questionable touch/pass from Jamie lead to an indirect freekick in the box. They blazed it over though.  
  
# Half Time  
  
Looking and feeling solid the Frothers went into the second half looking at securing the 3 points. Jarrod came close to making it 2 with a squared ball from Lance but had a shot saved and could only find the upright with the rebound.  
  
The moment of the half came as a North Wellington player was played in 1-1, with Ryan making himself big and saving.  
  
The Frothers saw out the half for the 4th win on the bounce and the first clean-sheet since opening day.  
  
# MoTM  
Evan was huge in midfield both on attack and defence. Supplying the assist made this one a no brainer.  
  
# DotD  
Lance for bodychecking a player, half dying on the field afterwards while getting hip thrusts from an opposing player was pretty good.

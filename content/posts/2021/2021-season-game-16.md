> Saving quiet Ryan

Coming into this week's match with a bit of a bounce in their step, the Frothers were out to protect that sweet boy between the sticks, **Ryan**.

Getting started with a bit of rough football the match soon fell into a rhythm of counter-attacking football for the Frothers. Comfortably weathering a few attacks the boys got underway with a nice through ball from Will which the patriot himself **Evan** ran onto and slotted by the keeper's right.

> 1-0

The first casualty happened just before halftime as **Jamie** injured himself and had to come off. Down to 12, the Frothers still felt confident.

## Halftime

At halftime, the second casualty came. Not wanting to jeopardize the Sule bloodline, **Will** was retired to just leave Thomas in the thick of it. Down to 11.

The Frothers really started to take the game as several nice plays resulted in the exploitation of a lot of space at the back. This proved telling as **Yarride** and the remaining **Sule** bounced passes back and forth in the box for **Yarride** to eventually score.

> 2-0

The bullets kept on flying, however, and Sule was caught by a rogue sniper in the hamstring. You hate to see it. Down to 10.

The Frothers started to sit a bit deeper and tightened up in an attempt to hold the lead. LBQ pushed forward to try to take advantage of this but overcommitted. **Yarride** was put through with 4 in pursuit. The keeper decided to make it 5 players rushing the ball, so **Yarride** expertly put it over him.

> 3-0

Back from the brink, **Jamie** came back on to play a pivot role to limit the amount of running. This paid dividends as we were able to break down almost all of their attacks. LBQ did manage to eventually breakthrough, with a bouncing ball in the box not properly cleared, and poked home.

> 3-1

It was too little too late though, and it easily could have been a wider margin with a couple of near misses from the Frothers.

The train continues!

# Man of the Match

Big **Sam** shut his wing down all evening and made several impressive runs forward, selling dummies, and on one occasion breaking multiple tackles to get all the way into the box.

# Dick of the Day

You hate to see it, and I have a special sympathy in my heart. Coming back from injury and not warming up to then injure yourself on a nothing ball. **Sule** has to take it.

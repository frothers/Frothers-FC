Entering the second round of the competition the Frothers were up against Valley FC for the third time this season. With the games 1 apiece it was all on the line.

This match welcomed back for a cameo the Baby Boy, Big Cat, **Stu Escott.** Starting on the bench of course.

The game started off in a pretty end to end fashion, with no side having the clear upper hand. The deadlock was broken by a shot outside of the box that dipped between **Ryan's** legs. Might pay to wear looser briefs next game.

## Man of the Match

**Sam** for all of the driving runs he made from left-back, and shutting down all of the play on that wing.

## Dick of the Day

**Charles** for being out toe-poked, where his effort went well over the bar.

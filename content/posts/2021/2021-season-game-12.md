Entering the second round of the competition the Frothers were up against Valley FC for the third time this season. With the games 1 apiece it was all on the line.

This match welcomed back for a cameo the Baby Boy, Big Cat, **Stu Escott.** Starting on the bench of course.

The game started off in a pretty end to end fashion, with no side having the clear upper hand. The deadlock was broken by a shot outside of the box that dipped between **Ryan's** legs. Might pay to wear looser undies next game.

> 0-1

Valley had a few other decent chances but were unable to convert them. The Frothers best opportunities came through a couple of **Alex** longshots.

## Half Time

Still within touching distance at the break, the Frothers tried to up the tempo in the second half. It was Valley who scored first, however, with a nasty deflected shot giving **Ryan** no chance.

> 0-2

Determined to try to put the game to bed Valley FC continued the attack, this time with a curling effort from outside of the box finding the bottom corner.

> 0-3

### Finally playing some football

From then on it was all Frothers. Getting some nice link-up play down the left, **Yarride** appeared at the back post to put it away with the left.

> 1-3

Continuing to put on the pressure, the Frothers again went on the attack. This time with **Will** finding **Lance** with a nice through ball, who calmly finished it.

> 2-3

Ooo baby it's back on! The Frothers on the march to steal some points. Would be a shame if we didn't mark one of them on a corner...

> 2-4

## Full time

A lot of positives to take from the match. With several players looking really good out there and scoring a couple of goals against a good team.

## Man of the Match

**Charles** for a solid game in the mids and backline. Showing it off with some twinkle toes in the box.

## Dick of the Day

**Stu** for losing his edge living on a beach in Nelson. Being gassed after 10 minutes, a flaccid bicycle kick attempt, and nutmegging himself. It was a tough watch.

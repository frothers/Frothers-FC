Another wet game but completely different football from the Frothers. Playing what was meant to be last year's cup final, the habibis ame out the stronger of the two teams.

Eventually scoring from a corner that wasn't dealt with, Habibis then followed it up with a long range effort and a penalty to go into the break up 3-0. The Frothers weren't without chances though, with **Sule** hitting the bar and other near attempts.

> Down 3-0 at half

Coming out hot in the second half the Frothers put the pressure on. **Yarride** grabbing the first goal after mopping up a cross.

Turning provider for the second goal, **Yarride** found **Harry** with a cross which he expertly headed into the net

> 3-2

Going down to the wire the Frothers won a penalty in the last minute. **Yarride** stepped up but could only find the keepers face.

## Man of the Match

**Yarride** for scoring and making the two goals and getting our hopes up.

## Dick of the Day

**Yarride** for missing his first penalty when it mattered most.

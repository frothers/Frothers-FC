> The streak ends..

On a wet and windy afternoon at Wellington College, the Frothers took on the Tuskan Raiders in the first round of the 1st Div WSFL.

## It's over!

In a game of few chances, the deadlock was eventually broken by a curling free-kick into the top corner. If you listen hard you can still hear the cry of "Over".

In the other notable chance of the first half, a header from **Sule** was cleared off the line.

# Second half

# Man of the Match

A huge display from **Lance**, both scoring and performing great hold-up play

# Dick of the Day

**Sam** for turning up late because he has to go back home to grab his socks. And tops it off with conceding a penalty. Consistency.

> The streak ends..

On a wet and windy afternoon at Wellington College, the Frothers took on the Tuskan Raiders in the first round of the 1st Div WSFL.

## It's over!

In a game of few chances, the deadlock was eventually broken by a curling free-kick into the top corner. If you listen hard you can still hear the cry of "Over".

In the other notable chance of the first half, a header from **Sule** was cleared off the line.

# Second half

Another tight half. **Yarride** drew a great save out of the keeper to keep the Raiders in front. The Frothers were struggling to move the ball up the field but weren't particularly under pressure themselves.

## Bust ups

The game started to get a bit scrappy, with altercations between several players. Maybe it was the game getting delayed by 15 minutes that got everyone off to a bad start.

## OG gives and it takes away

Following a weak attack, a desperate ball was kicked into the box. Under no pressure, the spirit of OG took control of **Jamie's** body and the resultant shinner from the middle of the box trickled into the back of the net.

Keeping the rain theme going, this weeks game was against the bottom of the table Black Bulls.

The game got off to a sluggish pace, with the Frothers eventually scoring first after a toe-poke by **Sule**.

> 1-0

The Black Bulls then got back in the game with a cross that wasn't dealt with and their striker poking in the follow-up.

> 1-1

Putting through-ball after through-ball they eventually jumped on an error by **Chris** and slotted home early to up.

> 2-1

Starting to put the pressure on, **Lance** found the keeper off his line and chipped him, with the attempted clearance taking it over.

> 2-2

## Man of the Match

**Yarride** for scoring and making the two goals and getting our hopes up.

## Dick of the Day

**Yarride** for missing his first penalty when it mattered most.

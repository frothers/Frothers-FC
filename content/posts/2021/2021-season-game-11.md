Keeping the rain theme going, this weeks game was against the bottom of the table Black Bulls.

The game got off to a sluggish pace, with the Frothers eventually scoring first after a toe-poke by **Sule**.

> 1-0

The Black Bulls then got back in the game with a cross that wasn't dealt with and their striker poking in the follow-up.

> 1-1

Putting through-ball after through-ball they eventually jumped on an error by **Chris** and slotted home early to up.

> 2-1

Starting to put the pressure on, **Lance** found the keeper off his line and chipped him, with the attempted clearance taking it over.

> 2-2

## Half time

The Black Bulls eventually took the lead again in the second half, where a shot outside of the box was followed in.

> 3-2

The Frothers then poured on the pressure. Which a clear penalty shout waved away as **Evan** was chopped in the box.

Not to be deprived, **Evan** then hammed a shot home as he came in from the right wing.

> 3-3

The end of the match was all Frothers, as another clear foul was waved away as **Will** was taken out on the edge of the box.

## Man of the Match

**Sam** for all of the driving runs he made from left-back, and shutting down all of the play on that wing.

## Dick of the Day

**Charles** for being out toe-poked, where his effort went well over the bar.

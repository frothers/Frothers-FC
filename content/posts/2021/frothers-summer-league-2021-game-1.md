The step down to Div2 had the Frothers facing new opposition in the Geckos. The new season gave official Frother debuts to **Bunting**, **Will,** and **Alain** after being ring-ins in the past, and they all showed their class early on as the Frothers took charge from the kickoff. Good link-up play between **Alain** and **Will** saw **Yarride** teed up for a shot but the keeper made a good low save.

After scoring off a corner the previous week, Frothers were starting to back themselves as set-piece specialists and after 4 corners in quick succession, they finally had something to show for it with **Harry Furnish** getting first to a second phase ball and finishing smartly.

> 1-0

5 minutes later and another corner reaped rewards, this time **Will** heading strongly past the keeper, proving to be as effective as his brother. The Geckos started to push towards the end of the first half but the Frothers stayed strong with **Tavis** and **Nick** solid at CB.

> 2-0

In the second half the Frothers were back on the front foot and **Will** quickly had a second goal, being put through on goal he finished calmly past the keeper.

> 3-0

**Milan** and **Jamie** were creating plenty from the full-back spots and soon after **Alain** scored off yet another corner before **Yarride** completed the scoring, finishing off a great team move including the high-class flick assist from **Charles**.

> 5-0

Despite the 5-0 scoreline, a couple of Frothers will be disappointed with the afternoon after spurning rare opportunities in front of goal. **Furnish** dribbled past 3 and shot against the bar with the rebound falling straight to **Charles** feet on the 6-yard box but with the goal at his mercy he went for power and could only hit the crossbar. Not to be outdone, **Ryan** sprinted up from keeper to take a penalty that **Harry** had won only to show his best Jordie Barrett impersonation and slotted through the middle of the rugby posts.

## Man of the Match

**Harry Furnish**, scoring a goal, should have had an assist, won a penalty and also made an incredible goal-line clearance with his head.

## Dick of the day

**Ryan**. Missing penalties is becoming a fashion.

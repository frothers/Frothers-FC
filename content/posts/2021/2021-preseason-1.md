# Out to settle the score

The first game of the 2021 tours was against none other than Sunday Blazers. Coming back with some tragic waistlines the Frothers would have been forgiven for being a bit behind the pace, and that is exactly what it looked like in the opening stages.

Though the Blazers had the majority of the play at the start, they weren't making much headway.

## Breakthrough

The Frothers were trialling a new Fantasy Football side project that wasn't as well understood by all players. Trying to pad his stats, Ryan laid on an unmissable opportunity for the Blazer's striker. Sadly assists only count for your own teams' goals. Though luck, Ryan.

## We're a second-half team

One-nil down at the break there was plenty out there for the lads to be encouraged by. It was time to pull out the forbidden fruit; goals by corners and crosses....

Stepping up in his debut, Sule scored a well-taken header off an Evan corner. Sensing blood in the water the Frothers then took it to the Blazers with another two quick goals. Lance volleyed home after a wonderful bit of play by Harry.

Evan, obviously dazed by the event of getting an assist off a corner then curled another corner in, except this time right at their keeper. Not knowing what a do a feeble punch went straight to an old friend of the Frothers, OG.

## Hit the self-destruct button

Now cruising, the Frothers decided to mix things up and put Yarride at centre back. Like a young antelope wandering into the deep waters of the lagoon, Yarride tried something cute and was set upon by the opposition ~~crocodiles~~ strikers. After the ball quickly came into the box, Nick, as on one of his tinder dates, laid it on a bit strong and it all went wrong. The ref called for a penalty and Alain stepped up and converted it.

Shortly after Alain shot from outside of the box to level it up. The ball squeezing between Ryan's legs like a cyclist in boardshorts.

## Time to shine

With the match looking like it might end up another draw it was time for the man with the legs that go on for miles to end his goal drought. Striding onto a Lance through ball Jarrod calmly slotted home over the keeper with the big left to win the game.

Frothers win 4-3. Absolutely buzzing for the next one.

# Out to settle the score

The first game of the 2021 tours was against none other than Sunday Blazers. Coming back with some tragic waistlines the Frothers would have been forgiven for being a bit behind the pace, and that is exactly what it looked like in the opening stages.

Though the Blazers had the majority of the play at the start, they weren't making much headway.

The Frothers were trialling a new Fantasy Football side project that wasn't as well understood by all players. Trying to pad his stats, Ryan laid on an unmissable opportunity for the Blazer's striker. Sadly assists only count for your own teams' goals, though luck, Ryan.

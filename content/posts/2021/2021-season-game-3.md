> Is it a derby?

This week saw the Frothers up against the second team of the Sunday Blazers, Los Blazeros.

# Fast Start for the New Kids

A relatively unknown quantity, Los Blazeros caught the boys by surprise by dominating the midfield. Good passing and running off the ball left the Frothers backline in disarray and lead to the first goal of the game.

> 0-1

Not wanting to leave it too long before a replay the Frothers put pressure on Los Blazeros' backline, forcing an error. **Yarride** calmly slotting home after been given the ball on the edge of the box. **Jamie** then tried to claim a key pass to their backline initially.... Not quite sure about that one.

> 1-1

The game stalled there for a while as neither team could take the upper hand in the midfield. The Frothers both being far too soft and giving away too many fouls in the middle of the park.

It was the former which lead to the breakthrough for the Blazeros, where a midfielder was able to stroll through the midfield almost unopposed before doing a one-two to get a one-on-one which they calmly finished.

> 1-2

# Inquiry

After a half where the Frothers never really got into gear, the boys needed to regroup. Words of encouragement (and some thinly veiled threats) were shared. It was time to turn it on.

Whether it was the speeches or the change in direction of the wind, there was an immediate improvement in the quality of the football being played.

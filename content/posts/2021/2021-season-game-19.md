On a windy and rainy day, the Frothers were playing on Wellington's windiest pitch. RIP ball boys.

The last game of the season was always going to be a tough one against a high flying Raiders team, but the Frothers were looking at keeping the winning streak going.

# First half

The game was quite end-to-end at the start, with no teams creating any real chances. The Frothers managed to get the lead through a great piece of defending from the front by **Sule**. Picking their pocket he let loose a strong shot from the edge of the box that the keeper could only flap at.

> 1-0

The Raiders started pouring on the pressure and it paid off quickly through a corner that want properly dealt with and swept home.

> 1-1

Another corner and another result from the Raiders. This time as the ball was cleared to the edge of the box a Raiders player hit a nice volley into the top of the goal.

> 1-2

Keeping the pressure on the Raiders were really playing some great football. They picked up a third goal as their forward picked up a ball behind him at full speed and touched it by **Ryan**.

> 1-3

Proving that football has no justice, the Raiders managed to get a fourth by a misplaced cross that make its way in off the back post.

> 1-4

Trying something straight out of the FIFA playbook, **Yarride** out a ball over the top straight from the kick-off that **Jarrod** ran onto and cooly finished.

> 2-4

# Halftime

After a goal fest of a first half the Frothers came out with the most energy in the second half.

The boys managed to get within touching distance as a misplaced clearance found its way to **Sule** who managed to curl one in from range.

> 3-4

Just when the Frothers were looking at making serious inroads at leveling the match the weather took a turn, making playing football near impossible.

This is summed up with **Charles** taking a first touch that almost took the floodlights out from a very routine pass.

This was tiring football and resulted in the Frothers leaving some late challenges in, with **Sule** picking up a yellow card.

**Yarride** managed to get a late chance, but the bobbling ball with the wind meant he could only put it over.

# Man of the match

**Jarrod** had another solid game up top and picked up a goal for his efforts.

# Dick of the day

**Evan** for ..._forgetting the beers..._ and waiting for what felt like an eternity for a pass to arrive to just let it go under his foot.

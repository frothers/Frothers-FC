## Kick them in the head

The Frothers started the game with real intent. Getting 3 freekicks for kicking players in the head in the first 10 minutes. Its not a great look, but who am I to discourage such hunger.

It didn't take long for the Frothers to open the scoring. Furnish found Yarride with a discusting amount of space inside the box and easied it into the courner.

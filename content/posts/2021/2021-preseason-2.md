## Kick them in the head

The Frothers started the game with real intent. Getting 3 freekicks for kicking players in the head in the first 10 minutes. It's not a great look, but who am I to discourage such hunger.

It didn't take long for the Frothers to open the scoring. Furnish found Yarride with a disgusting amount of space inside the box and easied it into the corner.

Not long after, the Diamonds' backline tried the old rondo trick of "If I don't touch it, it's not my fault." Allowing Yarride to stroll in and score his second.

## Baby Oil

The diamonds decided it was time for some route 1 stuff, bringing on the Frother's old nemesis up top.  Playing the battering ram, ~~Adama~~ Hector managed to pull one back through some casual play from the Frother's captain.

## Big OG

However, the Diamonds' celebrations were short-lived after the Frothers' old mate, OG, was back in business to take the lead to 3-1.

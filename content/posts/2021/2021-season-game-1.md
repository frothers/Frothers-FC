# Next Generation of Frothers

The Frothers started their new campaign with the debut of [Angus](/squad-members/angus-hay-chapman/) and [Sule](/squad-members/thomas-sule/).

The opening stages of the game were a bit cagey with the Pelicans repelling a few good efforts from the Frothers. The Frothers were growing in confidence as the new season nerves abated and started to boss possession and threatening more.

## Debut goal

Not long after the pressure paid off, with debutant Sule netting the opening goal direct from a corner. Backing up his one from preseason. Unbelievable.

## Backs it up

Not too long afterwards another goal from a cross came for the new man. **Harry** controlling a long ball that looked destined to be blown out for a goal kick. Beating his man, Harry delivered a great cross that Sule calmly finished.

## Denied from the line, twice

**Yarride,** worried about his golden boot, started to step it up. Twice beating the keeper on the edge of the box only to have the ball cleared off the line.

## Second half

The second half started and it was straight to Frothers football again. The field really started opening up as the Pelicans pushed for a goal, however, the balls over the top kept drifting through harmlessly to **Ryan**.

## Finally gets his goal

All this extra space is just what the doctor ordered for **Yarride**, as charging through he again got the keeper off his line. Making no mistake this time he buried it in the top corner.

## Oh and another 3

With the game well and truly open now the goals began to rain. **Yarride** scoring another, before **Sule** completed his hattrick off the back of a **Jamie** strike off the upright. Jamie then got his goal with a cool left-footed finish to the side of the keeper.

# Man of the Match

**Sule** for a debut hat-trick, enough said.

# Dick of the day

Injuring his butt squatting too much playing hockey, **Lance** had to miss the majority of the match.

> Doing 'em dirty..

Frothers got back to winning ways against a much-changed LBQ team from last season.

The game got off to a telling start as **Charles** got a yellow card for a very plain foul and LBQ got the first of many free-kicks that came to nothing.

## Big Sam would be proud

The first goal of the game came when a long ball over the top by **Angus.** **Yarride**, one-on-one with the keeper, bumped it over the top for a simple tap-in in front of the home fans.

> 1-0

# Half time

The Frothers came into the break 1-0 up, but the next half was into the wind, and uphill...

Valley FC came out the stronger of the two sides in the second half but was still missing a killer edge as their plays couldn't break through the backline.

## Just float it in

The leveller came from a free-kick quite far out. The Valley player lofted it into the wind and the ball ended up drifting in at the back-post after the bounce. One to forget.

> 1-1

## Ghosts in at the back

Valley then got themselves into the lead when a ball in from the left found an unmarked man at the back post. The player was able to calmly finish to put Valley into the lead.

> 1-2

## Able to hold on

Though the Frothers started upping the pressure they couldn't quite manage to get the breakthrough. **Yarride** had a great looking shot blacked by a valley defender.

The last telling moment was when **Milan** brought down a Valley player comfortably in the box. The ref then pointed to a freekick outside the box, causing a bit of anger...

# Man of the Match

**Angus** had a great game at the back and did everything he could to keep the opposition out.

# Dick of the Day

**Milan** for the sheer cheek for getting away with the foul in the box.

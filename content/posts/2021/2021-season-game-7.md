> Doing 'em dirty..

Frothers got back to winning ways against a much-changed LBQ team from last season.

The game got off to a telling start as **Charles** got a yellow card for a very plain foul and LBQ got the first of many free-kicks that came to nothing.

## Big Sam would be proud

The first goal of the game came when a long ball over the top by **Angus.** **Yarride**, one-on-one with the keeper, bumped it over the top for a simple tap-in in front of the home fans.

> 1-0

# Half time

The Frothers came into the break 1-0 up and feeling confident.

## What a save

Pushing for the equaliser, LBQ got a great chance when a long throw into the box was flicked on for a 1-on-1 with the keeper. **Ryan** pulled out a great save to deny the LBQ player and cause the follow-up effort to go over the bar.

## 2-Goal Swing

Shortly afterwards, another speculative ball out from deep by **Milan** got the LBQ defence in all sorts of trouble. As they tried to play it back to their keeper **Sule** ran through for the interception and a smart finish from a tight angle.

> 2-0

## Pull one back

LBQ managed to get a goal back as a clearance header was picked up on the edge of the box and cooly finished off the left.

> 2-1

## Try that longball game

The Frother's third goal came from one of the numerous free kicks in the match. In the Frothers half, **Chris** hung a long ball up at one of the LBQ centrebacks who failed to deal with it. This allowed **Lance** to run at goal and force the ball past for the third.

> 3-1

# Man of the Match

**Ryan** made several great saves and was a picture of confidence in goal.

# Dick of the Day

**Sule** for giving **Evan** shit about giving away bad fouls in dangerous positions, then getting a yellow for a shocking foul on the edge of the box.

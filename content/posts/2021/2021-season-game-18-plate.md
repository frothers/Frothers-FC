Just as the Frothers were getting on a roll covid struck back and delayed the season 3 weeks.  
  
Looking at repeating the same feat from last year, the Frothers were up against new opposition the super paddies fun club.

# First half

The game started off with the Frothers with the better of the possession, but were unable to find any real purchase in the final third.

Super paddies won a questionable free kick on the edge of the area. Lofting a ball into the box resulted in a goalmouth scramble with the ball eventually being poked home.

> 0-1

Not long after they doubled their lead, dribbling into the box from the right and then slotting home.

> 0-2

The Frothers rallied and saw out the half.

# Half Time

Of the two sides, it was Supper Paddies that started the stronger of the two teams in the second half. With the wind now behind them, they pinned the Frothers in their own box for extended periods of time.

Reinforcements came to the rescue through the **Sule** brothers. With both Tom and Will on the field, the mood quickly changed. **Sule** quickly found **Yarride** with only a single defender to take on. Putting his foot down he left the defender in his dust and smartly curled one around the keeper.

> 2-1

Knowing they had them against the ropes the Frothers went for the jugular. Lance got free up the wing and squared it for **Sule**. Releasing a shot that was parried the ball again made its way to **Yarride** who slotted it.

> 2-2

There were plenty of chances for a third for the Frothers, but it wasn't to be. To penalties

# Penalties

Supper Paddies won the toss and got to take their penalties first.

Their goalie stepped up first and put one in the corner.
> 0-1

**Lance** then stepped up and put a great penalty in the top left
> 1-1

The Paddies player kept them alive
> 4-4

> 5-4

Frother WIN! To the finals

# Man of the Match
**Sule** for having his brunch and eating it too. Fitting in a birthday lunch and then roll in for two match-saving assists is big frother energy.

# Dick of the Day
~~Yarride~~ took his shirt off after the penalty, but not the undershirt. But scored both the goals and the winning penalty, so itgoes to **Evan** for when the Frothers had one last chance to win it in regular time he put the corner straight out. Against the wind.

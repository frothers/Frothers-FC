With 3 players signing with new cities and another 1 hanging up the boots the club are looking to bring in the necessary reinforcements. They are hoping to secure their transfer business early in the window and avoid a deadline day disaster of Andy Carroll proportions. Due to Covid there will be no American preseason tour however a couple friendlies are expected before the new season kicks off on April 11th.

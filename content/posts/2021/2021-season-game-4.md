> Can they keep the streak going/

This weeks match was up against the team formally known as Lazy XI, a team that snuck a draw when we played last season.

In a scene not seen at the Frothers for a long time, **Ryan** needed to be replaced in goal. This week it was by **Jack**.

# Making it hard for ourselves

The game kicked off without any particular inspiring play from either side. A match that was a cagey affair last year looked destined to be heading the same way as the Frothers couldn't seem to make the right decisions with the ball.

After pinning Bond Sports Bar back in their half for a large period of play the breakthrough finally came when **Sule** burst through and slotted home.

> 1-0

Thinking the game was ready for a bit more possession football, the Frother started trying to string together a few more passes and play through the backline a bit more. This didn't work out so well this time as a misplaced pass between the centre backs allowed a Bonds striker to run through onto goal and put the ball past

> 1-1

# Inquiry

After a half where the Frothers never really got into gear, the boys needed to regroup. Words of encouragement (and some thinly veiled threats) were shared. It was time to turn it on.

Whether it was the speeches or the change in direction of the wind, there was an immediate improvement in the quality of the football being played.

## Harry Kane Would be Proud

After several promising looking attacks the breakthrough came through a bit of gamesmanship. **Yarride,** dispossessing a defender on the edge of the box, dashed into the box. Knowing the defender would be desperate to make amends **Yarride** folded under the first sign of contact. After taking 10 seconds to decide that a soft foul is still a foul the ref awarded the penalty.

The keeper tried to psyche out **Yarride** by doing a few body feints, so **Yarride** went with the tried and true of just hitting hard slightly off centre.

> 2-2

## Open the flood gates

With the game back on level terms, the Frothers started to turn up the pressure. Every attack had teeth and the opposition couldn't find respite anywhere on the pitch. **Sule** buried a goal not too long after and the boys were ahead.

> 3-2

**Yarride** then had an eternity of time to pick his spot as **Lance** and **Sule** passed the ball across the top of the opposition box, taking the whole backline out of the equation.

> 4-2

**Sule** then rounded the keeper (for the second time) and this time made sure of it to extend the lead.

> 5-2

Not to be outdone, **Yarride** also rounded the keeper and finished from a tight angle off the left to get his fourth.

> 6-2

# Man of the Match

Frother's baby daddy **Chris** for enforcing the stranglehold in the second half.

# Dick of the Day

Also **Chris**, for going for goal off a 45-yard free-kick and sending it deep into the stands, and getting too real with the _encouragement_. Sorry Boys.

### Honourable mention:

**Harry** for trying to bang home a one-on-one and sending it comfortably over the top.

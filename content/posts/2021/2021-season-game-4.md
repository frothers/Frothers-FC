> Can they keep the streak going?

This weeks match was up against the team formally known as Lazy XI, a team that snuck a draw when we played last season.

In a scene not seen at the Frothers for a long time, **Ryan** needed to be replaced in goal. This week it was by **Jack**.

# Making it hard for ourselves

The game kicked off without any particular inspiring play from either side. A match that was a cagey affair last year looked destined to be heading the same way as the Frothers couldn't seem to make the right decisions with the ball.

After pinning Bond Sports Bar back in their half for a large period of play the breakthrough finally came when **Sule** burst through and slotted home.

> 1-0

Thinking the game was ready for a bit more possession football, the Frother started trying to string together a few more passes and play through the backline a bit more. This didn't work out so well this time as a misplaced pass between the centre backs allowed a Bonds striker to run through onto goal and put the ball past

> 1-1

# Now that's football

Not letting the goal conceded get them down, the Frothers continued to put on a passing performance. This time it paid off as several nice passes were put together, stretching the opposition backline and resulting in **Evan** running onto a ball on the edge of the box and putting a first-time finish past the keeper. Breaking his yearlong goal drought.

> 2-1

## Half-time

Going into the break up was a big boost for the boys. They were so excited to start the second half **Jack** forgot to put his gloves on, resulting in the kickoff having to be taken again.

The second half started off with a couple of missed chances from the Frother, albeit one being from **Charles**. One man who didn't miss out was **Lance**, who scored his first goal of the campaign to give the boys a buffer.

> 3-1

## He was only 2 metres inside...

Desperate to get back in the game Bonds started pushing their midfielders forward more. This paid off as one of their midfielders was able to make a late run into the box before being brought down by **Sam.**

The resulting penalty was put rather unconvincingly to the wrong side of the keeper and Bonds had a sniff.

> 3-2

But the lads kept em out.

# Man of the Match

A huge display from **Lance**, both scoring and performing great hold-up play

# Dick of the Day

**Sam** for turning up late because he has to go back home to grab his socks. And tops it off with conceding a penalty. Consistency.

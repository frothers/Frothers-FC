> Time to test them new shirts out

Coming off the high of last week's win the Frothers finally got to run out their new kit.

Valley FC was a step up on last week's opposition and held the ball well throughout the park. The Frothers were struggling to find their rhythm for the first part of the game.

## Pretty good hit, really

The breakthrough came through a great hit from the Valley FC striker. After a questionable clearance from an unnamed Frothers player, a thunderbolt took Ryan out of the game.

> 0-1

## Return of the divine

The goal was just what the Frothers needed to get into the swing of things. Several good chances then came, with Sule, Jack, and Jamie coming close. The corner following one of these chances was just the opportunity an old friend of the Frothers needed. OG laid his divine touch on a flick on by Sule to level the game up.

> 1-1

## Halftime

Geed up by the positive end to the half the Frothers came out with thirst in the second half, but it was Valley FC who came out stronger. With only a couple of minutes on the clock, Jack put his boot through one of the Valley players. 

> Penalty

Ryan, showing off why he won the Best Rookie award in 2020 in the fixture he struggled in last year, pulls off the save!

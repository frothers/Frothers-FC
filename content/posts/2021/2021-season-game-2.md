> Time to test them new shirts out

Coming off the high of last week's win the Frothers finally got to run out their new kit.

Valley FC was a step up on last week's opposition and held the ball well throughout the park. The Frothers were struggling to find their rhythm for the first part of the game.

## Pretty good hit, really

The breakthrough came through a great hit from the Valley FC striker. After a questionable clearance from an unnamed Frothers player, a thunderbolt took **Ryan** out of the game.

> 0-1

## Return of the divine

The goal was just what the Frothers needed to get into the swing of things. Several good chances then came, with **Sule**, **Jack**, and **Jamie** coming close. The corner following one of these chances was just the opportunity an old friend of the Frothers needed. **OG** laid his divine touch on a flick on by **Sule** to level the game up.

> 1-1

## Halftime

Geed up by the positive end to the half the Frothers came out with thirst in the second half, but it was Valley FC who came out stronger. With only a couple of minutes on the clock, **Jack** put his boot through one of the Valley players.

> Penalty

**Ryan**, showing off why he won the Best Rookie award in 2020 in the fixture he struggled in last year, pulls off the save!

> Penalty Save!

## Too much of a gentleman

It was time for the Frothers to turn the screw. With the gaps starting to open up in the second half the chances started to flow. The decisive moment came when, on a breakaway, **Yarride** lobbed the keeper. **Lance** following in appeared to have an easy tap in, but in an act of pure friendship tried to just follow the shot in. The goalie managed to get back in time, and the following scraps were jumped on by **Yarride** to bury it, finally.

> 2-1

## Hold on

With the light fading, the Frothers decided to set up to hold what they had. Weathering several dangerous attacks the final whistle eventually came to mark a hard-fought win.

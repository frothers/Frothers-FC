On a wet night at the St Pats turf, a rather uninspiring match played out between the Blazers and the Frothers. Even the ref looked like he couldn't be arsed.

Getting the lead through a deflected strike, the Blazers held on for the remainder of the game as the Frother couldn't string a good set of passes together. Probably just focus on next weeks game.

## Man of the Match

**Angus** for making some killer slide tackles.

## Dick of the Day

**Evan** for hitting the first man on what felt like 10 corner kicks.

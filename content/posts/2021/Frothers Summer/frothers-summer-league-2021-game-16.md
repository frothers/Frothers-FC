Riding into the game with just 2 points needed in the next 3 games to seal the season the Frothers knew they could see it out today. They were playing a Super Paddies team that defaulted last week for a stag do, the boys knew there were likely some cobwebs still knocking around.

The dynamic Strike pair of **Lance** and **Yarride** were absent due to wider life decisions. One in an unending cycle of torment, secretly questioning his life choices about breaking a cycle he knew and could control, and the other having a baby. This left a void in the starting 11 that the boys were only too keen to fill.

Coming off the back of scoring a penalty in the last game, I (**Chris**) fancied myself as a bit of a goal scorer. However, It wasn't long before delusion became revelation. Big Daddy chemistry came into full swing as **Charles** chipped a through ball over with a touch of leg break that would make Warne proud. Running onto the ball a first time shot off the left from the edge of the box was enough to find the bottom corner and start the belief.

> 1-0

The hot-out-the-gates start took a bit of a hit, and for the rest of the half it was pretty evenly matched, with the Frothers struggling to recapture the magic. A clearance off the line by the Frothers and a shot off the post by **Alain** were as close as it got.

## Halftime

A bit of a charge up of positions at halftime reaped almost instant rewards. **Alain**, seeing that anyone had a shot at scoring up top, took his chance. After initially punting a kickoff straight out, he found a much better opportunity in the next play. Being played in by a deflected touch that **Bunting** is claiming as an assist, **Alain** calmly finished into the far corner to make it 2.

> 2-0

Not long afterwards he claimed his second. A floated in freekick by **Nick** found **Alain** all alone in the box. An excellent touch and a hard shot were enough to extend the lead.

> 3-0

Really hitting his stride, it wasn't long until **Alain** was amongst another goal. This time as the provider. A corner into a dangerous area found **Jack H** who cleanly headed it into the back of the net.

> 4-0

Passing the batten on, **Jack H** was the next player to be in the thick of it. Being played in by a glorious ball, he kept his run going and powered a bouncing ball into the top of the net.

> 5-0

### Man of the Match

**Alain** really changed the tide of the game and had several handy contributions throughout.

### Dick of the day

Poor old **Jack K** still can't get that monkey off his back. Got put up top for the last 20 and had some really good chances that he couldn't quite find a way to finish.

### Extend the clan

Another week, another Frother baby. This time from an Ex-Frother with deep roots in the team, **Jack Furnish**. Congrats jack! ðŸ‘¼

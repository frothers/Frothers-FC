Top of the table clash against Big Kicks, going for 8 wins in a row.

## First Half

On a windy day at Wellington College, the Frothers took early control of the possession and were dictating the play. Lacking the last pass the Frothers just needed one shot of inspiration to get the lead. This came through **Yarride** coming off the bench to race onto a through-ball by **Will** and finish past the keeper off his left.

> 1-0

Big Kicks hadn't really created everything, with most of their attacks coming through long punts over the top. They managed to get themselves a corner off pressuring a resulting throw-in. The ball was half-cleared before **Alain** scuffed a Big Kicks player with a slightly mistimed challenge. The resultant shriek from the player was enough to convince the ref to award a soft penalty.

Sending **Ryan** the wrong way the Big Kicks player levelled it up.

> 1-1 

## Second Half

Arriving in time for the second half, it took **Lance** no time at all to get the Frother back ahead. Running onto an over the top ball from **Nestor**, **Lance** chipped the keeper with his first real touch of the ball.

> 2-1

The Big Kicks managed to win themselves a freekick in a similar spot to which the Frother conceded from last week. Again the delivery was overhit going straight to, and through, **Ryan.**

> 2-2

Heartened from levelling the score, Big Kicks had several long-range shot parried away before Frothers could start to play their football again.

It was **Lance** again who was the man with the eye for goal. Racing through on goal and finishing off the far post.

> 3-2

The Big Kicks almost pulled it level with one of the last kicks of the game. A quickly taken freekick forced a great straight arm diving save out of **Ryan**.

# Man of the Match

**Lance,** only showing up at halftime scored two very well taken goals and looked very sharp.

# Dick of the Day

**Ryan** has this name all over this for the second week running before pulling out a redemption story of biblical proportions. The prize then falls to the grub in the middle, **Alain**.

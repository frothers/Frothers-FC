Second game back and the Frothers were looking at bouncing back and both avenge the loss in the reverse figure. Getting back into winning ways would also be a treat.

Happening on the same day as the Australian Open final, this game had all the billings of a final as well; the Blues were the primary contender for the top spot this season. A Serbian was also notably missing from this match as **Milan** was bringing life into this world, rather than trying to do the opposite ðŸ‘€.

On a baking hot day at Te Whaea, the Frothers started the game on the front foot. The new signings of **Cole** and the secondment of **Isaac** ensured we could be dangerous with every possession.

A few early opportunities went begging, but some quick feet and a cheeky toe by **Cole** meant we went into the drinks break 1-0.

> 1-0

It was more dominance by the Frothers after the break with the offside trap being sprung to put **Isaac** through for the first of his goals.

> 2-0

## Halftime

A few additional reinforcements turned up for the Blues during the halftime break, but they would need more than that.

A similar pattern emerged in the 3rd quarter, with Isaac again being put in to grab his second.

> 3-0

Just before the break, the Blues managed to find themselves a way back into the game. A shot from outside the box ended up being pushed into the path of an on running Blues striker who found the open net.

> 3-1

The fourth quarter would be all Frothers, however. A well-won freekick in the opposition half gave **Nick** the opportunity to put in a beauty of a delivery that lured the keeper into no man's land and left **Alain** with a simple header.

> 4-1

In the game's dying moments **Harry** was dancing all around the Blue's LB who eventual had enough and fouled him. Playing the freekick quickly, **Harry** delivered a peach of a ball for **Isaac** to volley in his stride for the hattrick.

> 5-1

## Man of the Match

**Harry Furnish** for the excellent scouting and a great game for himself too.

## Dick of the Day

There were a few moments in the match where the Frothers risked being a shithouse team. Yelling at the ref, claiming the ball had gone out, pushing other players... You never want to be the worst team in the league at it. Just second worst.

The man trying to make sense of the new world he lives in, **Nester**, gets the nod for running his mouth more than his legs today.

Honourable mentions go to **Alain's** free-kick which is currently off to join the new James Webb telescope ðŸ”­.

Back into winter league with a tough game first up. LBQ has been on a spending spree over the summer and had a new frontline consisting of players from various other teams in the league.

It was good to see the familiar faces of **Jarrod** and **Angus** with the inclusion of **Alain**, **Tyler**, and **Jacob** for their rookie seasons.

## First Half

The game started relatively even, with the Frother arguably having the better of the chances. Hitting the bar twice and having a good shot from **Lance** saved.

The breakthrough came from multiple poor clearances from the Frothers which the LBQ striker was able to jump on and nudge around **Ryan.**

> 0-1

The other goals in the half were all screamers from outside of the box.

> 0-4

## Halftime

Though they were down heavily on the scoreline the Frothers weren't too disheartened as the game was a lot closer than the scoreline indicated.

The Frothers eventually got their just rewards as **Charles** and **Evan** linked up with a nice one-two which **Evan** put away emphatically.

> 1-6?

**Evan** with another goal and endless running on a hot tiring match.

## Dick of the Day

**Chris** left the kit bag again, making it two from two.

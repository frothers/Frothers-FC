Frothers FC snuck a 2-1 win over Unilaterals with **Alain** and **Sule** scoring the goals.

**Alain** managed to ghost in front of the keeper from a **Yarride** freekick to claim his second in as many matches.

> 1-0

Chance after chance went begging for the Frothers who were dominating the match.

Finally, the Frothers got their second with **Milan** cutting a ball square to **Sule** for a tap in.

> 2-0

A stunning volley from the opposition and bad finishing from a range of Frothers led to a nervy finish but the boys were able to hold on.

> 2-1

Notably, **Charles Daily** with a header off the line with the last touch of the game.

## Man of the Match

**Alain** for having a solid game at the back and picking up a goal to boot.

## Dick of the Day

**Alain** with the double, for rocking a basketball jersey all match when there were spare Frothers jerseys.

A top of the table clash against Big Kicks and it gave the Frothers the opportunity to open up the gap at the top of the table.

The Frothers had a bare bones XI, with several of the players either coming back from injury, or sporting minor niggles.

The first half was a tight affair, with the Frother's best opportunities coming off the back of a couple of corners. **Lance** was also denied by a great save.

## Halftime

Playing with the wind, the Frothers knew they could up the ante in the second half.

It didn't take long until the boys got into their stride. **Alain** won a great challenge in the middle to set-up the counter-attack. **Evan**? then put **Yarride** in who wriggled away from the two defenders to score.

> 1-0

Not long after the Frother's doubled their lead. This time coming from a full field passing move from centre back through the midfield. It finally fell to **Bunting** who played **Yarride** clean through. You know what comes next.

> 2-0

The Frothers were now starting to strut a little, with more slick passing and confident possession.

Big Kicks managed to get back in the game with a pretty nothing punt the eluded the backline and fell to the Big Kicks' winger. Cutting inside he finished with a filthy robona.

> 2-1

Feeling there was something in the game for them the Big Kicks kept coming. It wasn't long until a scoop turn nutmeg in the box was enough to get **Jamie Hatch** to throw out the leg and give the Big Kicks a penalty.

The same penalty taker from the last match stepped up. Luckily **Ryan** had done his homework and correctly guessed he would shoot in the same spot.

> Save!

With Big kicks deflated by the missed penalty the Frothers took advantage. **Jamie Hatch**, making amends for the penalty, intercepted a ball and quickly put **Lance** in who gave the defender a quick body feint to get through 1-on-1 and finish to the right.

> 3-1

## Man of the match
**Ryan** gotta take this out for a pretty faultless match with a penalty save to boot. Becoming a real specialist!

## Dick of the Day
**Milan** for making his way right up into the box, getting the pass, and then doing a dummy when no-one was behind him. Understandable to get a bit light headed that far up the pitch.

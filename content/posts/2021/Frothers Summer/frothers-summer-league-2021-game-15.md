Much of the build-up to Sundays game with the Vultures was focused on the weather with a couple of Frother Fathers pleading for a cancellation. However, the club‚Äôs philosophy of ‚Äúplaying no matter how shite Welly gets‚Äù came to the fore and the boys were ready to go. 

At this point, the writer would like to be (James) Blunt with you and say the game was pretty boring. Most of the 90 minutes were spent watching the ball roll to every corner of Wakefield Park bar the white nets. However, 5 players stood out in the wind and rain and deserve special mention. 

**Charles Daily** made his presence felt like a truckie in downtown Ottawa. The one dad in the team who prioritises playing football over staying healthy for their child absolutely bossed the midfield and led the boys well.

**Jamie Bunting** showed all the class of a 20-year-old kiwi snowboarder in Beijing, earning a strong 92.88. Was the most creative on the field and his partnership with Charles hinted at what Waikato uni were blessed with all those years ago.

In the absence of regular CB Chris Maldini, **Nick Jones** stepped up to lead the backline in the face of a dangerous Vultures attack. Apparently, he is now being scouted by the Ukrainian army for his ruthless defensive work. Did get a yellow for a dirty tackle though.

**Jamie Hatch** was Cyclone Dovi in human form creating havoc down the east coast all day. The only player seemingly unaffected by the weather, **Hatch** was a constant threat with his speed from minute 1 to 90. A huge performance.

**Ryan** made use of the slick surface, as he slid around his box quicker than a cat slides along a French centre back‚Äôs living room in west London. (Frothers FC stands with SPCA in the battle against animal cruelty.) In tough conditions for any goalkeeper, **Kindell** showed great hands and composure to keep a clean sheet. 

All the impressive work done by the team counted for nothing with **Yarride** proving as effective upfront as Trevor Mallard‚Äôs scare tactics. The Frothers thought they were in with a chance when **Alain** confidently stepped up to take a free-kick but could only hit the wall from 45 metres out.

Shooting blanks is strictly a football problem for the club though as the next generation continues to grow. Massive congratulations to Club President Lance Molyneaux and his wife Kate who gave birth to a beautiful baby boy over the weekend. And also to OG Frother Max Hall and his partner Shauni who also had a boy last week. Watch out Sunday League season 2050. üë∂üë∂üë∂

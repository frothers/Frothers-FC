This was the game everyone had been waiting for, a clash between the two best teams in the division.

On another classic wet and windy Wellington college night, the Frothers got to start the game with the wind at their back.

It didn't take long before they took the lead with a great ball through by **Jamie Bunting** found **Yarride** 1-on-1 with the keeper. Keeping his cool he made it count to keep the race to 1:1 goals per game alive.

> 1-0

The half was all Frothers with several nearly plays not quite doing it.

The Blues somehow found their way back into it with a ball over the top expertly brought down by their striker and finished.

> 1-1

The Frothers should have had a shot to go back ahead before the break as **Yarride** was clearly brought down in the area by the opposition goalie, only for the ref to wave it away.

## Halftime

The Frothers were ruing their missed chances as they knew they had the wind to contest within the second half.

The two sides were even until a couple of Frothers mistakes changed the game.

An attempted quick free-kick that went straight to a Blues player led to a goalkeeper clearance that again only found the first Blues player who fired into the top of the goal to take the lead.

> 1-2

The next goal was also the result of a couple of missed defensive clearances that resulted in a shot on an open net.

> 1-3

Disappointing result, but the run had to end sometime ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# Man of the match

**Yarride** for keeping his scoring streak alive while having two decent penalty shouts ignored.

# Dick of the day

**Jamie Bunting** for having a bit of a brain explosion coming straight off the bench to quickly take a free-kick to catch the defence off guard. Pity it was the wrong defence...

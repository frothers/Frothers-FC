A few big milestones in this one. **Jamie Hatch** being the first Frother to bring up 100 matches. There was also a big turn out from the fresh Dad crew. **Lance**, **Charles**, **Milan**, and a surprise appearance from **Nestor**.  
  
Although the league was already sewn up, it was #1 Vs #2 and the head to head record was on the line. Also it was the last week of Summer League and the boys would need to live off this froth for a few weeks.  
  
The Frothers took control of the match early, finding lots of time on the ball. It was almost the dream start for *Jamie H* when he was found at the back post. A bobbled shot managed to beat the keeper, but was cleared off the line.  
  
Luckily the next opportunity at the back post was seen to. **Lance**, following up on a similar goal last week, nearly side footed it in.  
  
The next chance came to **Charles**, the man trying to make up ground on the other OGs fired a great looking shot that was destined to clip the underside of the bar. However, a sneaky couple of fingers came out of the blue to nudge the ball over the bar.  
  
Seeing the incident and the incredulity on **Charles**' face the ref pointed to the spot. Looking for redemption, **Charles** was handed the ball. Many things could be said about my sweet boy's penalty record, but you won't hear me saying them.  
  
Sadly muscle memory let **Charles** down, where he couldn't help but send a knee heigh ball to the keepers left. Good thing *Jack K* was absent, as that would be sure to trigger PTSD.

A few big milestones in this one. **Jamie Hatch** is the first Frother to bring up 100 matches 🙌🙌. There was also a big turnout from the fresh Dad crew. **Lance**, **Charles**, **Milan**, and a surprise appearance from **Nestor**.

Although the league was already sewn up, it was #1 Vs #2 and the head to head record was on the line. Also, it was the last week of Summer League and the boys would need to live off this froth for a few weeks.

The Frothers took control of the match early, finding lots of time on the ball. It was almost the dream start for _Jamie H_ when he was found at the back post. A bobbled shot managed to beat the keeper but was cleared off the line.

Luckily the next opportunity at the back post was seen to. **Lance**, following up on a similar goal last week, nearly side-footed it in.

> 1-0

The next chance came to **Charles**, the man trying to make up ground on the other OGs fired a great looking shot that was destined to clip the underside of the bar. However, a sneaky couple of fingers came out of the blue to nudge the ball over the bar.

Seeing the incident and the incredulity on **Charles**' face the ref pointed to the spot. Looking for redemption, **Charles** was handed the ball. Many things could be said about my sweet boy's penalty record, but you won't hear me saying them.

Sadly muscle memory let **Charles** down, and he couldn't help but send a knee heigh ball to the keeper's left. Good thing **Jack K** was absent, as that would be sure to trigger PTSD.

Things only went one way for Hamilton's favourite son... Barely 5 minutes had passed and the Majin Blues were awarded a penalty from a missed challenge in the box by the Kid. However, maybe there was more to taking penalties today than meets the eye as the Blue's player also couldn't convert the penalty. **Ryan** making yet another save from the spot to keep the Frothers in the lead. **Jamie** still cannot believe he missed the follow-up.

Another chance went begging for the Frothers, this time by **Yarride**. A squared ball could only find the standing leg. Luckily the Frothers bat deep. **Evan** stepped up to give the Frothers the breathing room they deserved. Hitting a dipping shot that the keeper could only swat at.

> 2-0

## Halftime

The second half resulted in the Frothers being under the pump for the majority of the half. **Ryan** came up with a couple more great stops to keep the Frother in front.

The Blues eventually scored through a through-ball that the attacker had all day to run onto.

> 2-1

But it was too little too late and the Frothers opened up the lead on the table to a staggering 20 points 🤯. 👋👋 See ya!

## Man of the Match

Yet another penalty save with a handful of solid saves, the lad **Ryan** has really come alive in summer league.

## Dick of the Day

Could only be one. To miss a penalty to only concede one minutes later is a pretty high bar, **Charles**. At least it didn't matter in the end 🤷‍♀️ Hang in there, King

Special mention to **Yarride**, who after seeing **Alain** fluff a couple of shots of the kick-off decided to get himself a round of boos as well.

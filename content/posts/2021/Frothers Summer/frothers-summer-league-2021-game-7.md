Looking to keep their hot run of form going, the Frothers next match was against the Diamonds.

Looking to bring home the 3 points for the newest Frother, **Javier Frother Daily**.

## First Half

The Frothers struggled to find that final pass in the first half. They dominated possession and had the majority of the chances, but couldn't quite find the killer edge.

## Second Half

It didn't take long in the second half until the Frothers turned to their trusted source of goals, **Yarride**. Having the ball put on an absolute plate by **Will**, he calmly put it to the keepers right.

> 1-0

Not long after the Frothers won a freekick just within the opposition half. Batting away the pretenders, Yarride took the ball and curled a beautiful ball into the box which **Evan** headed on for **Jamie Hatch** to finish.

> 2-0

Looking for all the world like it was going to be yet another clean sheet the Diamonds managed to ride their luck to get back in it. Overhitting a long free-kick, the ball managed to loop into the top of the goal on the full.

> 2-1

That was to be the last of the Diamonds chances though. As the Frothers saw the game out for 6 wins in a row.

# Man of the Match

**Jamie Bunting** bossed the middle of the park and is really starting to feel more comfortable in the Frother's uniform.

# Dick of the Day

**Jamie Hatch** comes close for kicking the ball into a Diamonds player's back when trying to give them the ball back after an injury. However, it goes to **Ryan** for keeping 3 clean sheets in a row but to let one drift in over his head from 35 out.

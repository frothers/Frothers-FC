Starting the second half of the summer season the Frothers played an unrecognisable Diamonds team (because it was full of div 1 players...). It was also a debut for **Jacob**, another transfer from the Kindle connection.

The Frothers were showing they were no strangers to a Christmas pud with some slow legs and dusty touches. However, they hadn't lost their discipline and kept the game relatively even for most of the first half.

The ~~Alts~~ Diamonds ended up taking the lead with a great lofted ball in from the right and headed home.

> 0-1

**Ryan** performed several great saves to keep the goals to just the one at the break.

The Frothers managed to rally at halftime, and it didn't take long before they equalled it up. **Milan** finding **Lance**, who broke through a double challenge to get through to the opposition penalty area. Unselfishly laying it off to **Yarride** to finish off on the left.

> 1-1

That is what the boys were needing and the Frothers started to find their passing rhythm.

However, with injury forcing **Lance** off the boys were struggling to find any real opportunities.

It was the Diamonds who got the next opportunity. With a handball on the line from **Milan** being spotted by the ref, a penalty was awarded. The diamonds player could only find the crossbar, however.

> Penalty miss

A later attack resulted in another goal-line clearance from **Milan**, legally this time, but this time the Diamonds player finished the follow-up.

> 1-2

A third goal followed after. 🤷‍♂️

> 1-3

## Man of the match

**Ryan** had a near faultless game, with several big saves and bringing big Buffon energy to penalties yet again.

## Dick of the day

A few contenders for this one. **Yarride** for getting sent off by the ref for no shin pads. Baby daddy **Nestor** for the unstoppable freight train run into their keeper. But the award goes to the man about to get his own turn at fatherhood, **Milan**.

Doing his best Saurez, lying about it, only getting a yellow. And then rolling the dice all over again. You love to see it, you hate to live it.

It was the deciding game against the Valley dream and it was all too play for, with a win enough to take the Frothers to the top of the table.

The Frothers took control of the match from the start on yet another windy day at Wellington College.

The first real moment of note came with the loss of **Jack Hayden** to a rolled ankle. Leaving the Frothers without any subs. Luckily these boys have been doing their conditioning training and have the bodies to show for it.

As if taking this as a challenge, the balls over the top started to rain. **Lance** and **Evan**, given the task of chasing the windblown balls, eventually got their just rewards by combining for the first goal.

> 1-0

A corner in was headed straight back to **Evan**, whose first-time ball on the valley found **Lance**. Beating the keep to the jump, it is yet another headed goal for the team's coxswain.

## Halftime

A little disappointed to only have the one goal in a wind which is known to have goals with it, but the Frothers knew they had more than just the wind up their sleeves.

The second half started again with the Frothers controlling the match, but the Valley nearly snuck a goal as a long ball from deep came off the crossbar and hit their player to go in. Unfortunately for the player he had raised his hands and caught the ball, which some keen-eyed Frothers spotted. So the goal was ruled out.

Riding in to save the day, my boy **Yarride** strolls on after 60 mins in the wind and the rain to help himself to two goals.

The second goal came from a low clearance from your boy, that the Valley defender let slip under his boot and **Evan** picked it up and put **Yarride** in. Who put a clinic on of how close you can put it by the keeper and still score.

> 2-0

Not long after Valley started a counter-attack down the right where they had acres of space. However, they managed to pick out the only Frother there, **Jamie Hatch**. **Hatch** then put **Yarride** in for his second and a much more ruthless finish.

> 3-0

The end wasn't without drama as a charging **Ryan** went for a knee slide collection of a ball in his box, only to sail right by. The striker could only put it right across the goal from a tight angle.

## Man of the match

Lots of candidates for this one. **Lance** and **Yarride** for their goals. The defence for the clean sheet and low xGA. But this week it goes to the cameraman's favourite, **Evan**. Two good assists and a top work rate.

## Dick of the Day

**Charles "Family Man" Daily** for teasing us with the prospect that he will come to a game for a couple of weeks and yet another no show. Sleep is temporary, football is forever.

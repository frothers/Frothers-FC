In the rematch of the plate final a month ago, the Frothers were out looking for revenge against the Valley Dream.

It didn't take long for the Frothers to take control of the game and as the wind picked up **Charles** put a nice ball over the top for **Sule** to run onto and then it put it over the top of the keeper.

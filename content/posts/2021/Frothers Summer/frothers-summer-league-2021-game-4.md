In the rematch of the plate final a month ago, the Frothers were out looking for revenge against the Valley Dream.

It didn't take long for the Frothers to take control of the game and as the wind picked up **Charles** put a nice ball over the top for **Sule** to run onto and then it put it over the top of the keeper.

> 1-0

After a few more nearly attacks, the Frothers struck again. This time for **Will** how had a ball squared to him after a lovely spell of passing.

> 2-0

Looking to dispel the ghosts of the final where we also had a 2-0 lead the boys were putting their bodies on the line. **Yarride** got crunched when arriving second to an aerial challenge while playing at centreback. but, it was enough to get the boys into halftime.

## Second Half

The second half saw more of the same, as the Frothers quickly started to dominate things again.

The closest the Valley FC came in this passage was a shocking dive in the box which the ref rightly waved away.

The Frothers then put the foot down, with another great passing play finished off by **Will** again.

> 3-0

The game was still to have some controversy, as a ball that was being guided out by defences and goalkeeper was able to be played back into the middle of the box. The Valley player thought that it was only **Yarride** on the line to beat. However, **Yarride _Suarez_ Rosario** pulled a move right out of the **Charles Dailey** playbook and swatted the ball away using his hand.

With no choice, the Ref sent **Yarride** off for the first red card since **Charles** also handled a ball several seasons ago.

This turned out to be the ultimate power move, however, as **Ryan** stepped up to deny the same penalty taker that won Valley the final. Proving again is Tim Krul status of being all about the penalties.

# Man of the Match

Initial thoughts were for **Will** with the brace and reclaiming the top scorer spot. However, a clean sheet and a penalty save means it has to go to **Ryan.**

# Dick of the Day

**Yarride** for the shocking sportsmanship, even if it did mean we kept the clean sheet....

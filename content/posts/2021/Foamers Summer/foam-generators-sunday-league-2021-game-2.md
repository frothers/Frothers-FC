Frothers FC made their summer league debut while the youth academy, Foam Generators played for the very first time on Sunday at Te Whaea. The youth team kicked off first against Punishing Chat and a close half ended with a narrow 1-0 deficit for the Foamies. PC scored early in the second before Sule got one back but then missed a couple of great chances to even things up. 2 late goals to PC and it ended 4-1 but a lot of potential for Foamies this summer.

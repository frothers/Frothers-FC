## The Blazers Derby

In an unusually early 11 am kickoff a few of the boys were still waking up when the game kicked off.

The start of the game was all Blazers with the Frothers being pinned back in our half. They eventually took the lead through a freekick which was deflected into the middle of the box and the Blazers player shot the resulting rebound into the corner.

> 0-1

The Frothers managed to rally and string together a couple of good moves until a great cross in by **Yarride** found **Tayler** who put an expertly placed first-time finish on the half volley to the left of the goal.

> 1-1

The no subs for the Frothers started to take its toll though. A sneaky move of seconding one of the Blazers players paid some dividends as there was a bit of respite for the lads.

## Second half

The game started to stretch out as both sets of players continued to tire on a hot April day. The Blazers had the next big opportunity with a chip over the keeper cleared off the line by **Angus**.

The Frothers then had the next few opportunities with Alain having a strong shot saved and putting a header off a corner just wide.

The game came to an end with a few more half-chances, but nothing looked like breaking the deadlock

## Man of the Match

**Angus'** goal-line clearance was the real difference-maker on the day and he takes home the award.

## Dick of the Day

None this week, a pretty good showing from everyone!

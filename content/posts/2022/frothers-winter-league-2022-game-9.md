A wet and windy Sunday morning in the capital resulted in a depleted Frothers squad being available for their first match in Div 2 of the winter. A couple of timely ring-ins saved the day.

As with previous encounters with the Lazy XI they defended well as a unit, locking up the middle of the pitch and leaving the Frothers frustrated. Balls over the top were also difficult due to the wind.

The first real point of action in the game came with **Lance** being taken out in the box from behind. This was waved away.

Lazy XI took the lead through a deflected shot from the edge of the box.

> 0-1

## Halftime

The Frothers knew they were still well in this match and the change on end could help them with the reversed wind.

Moments into the second half this proved to be the case. **Jacob** intercepted the ball and played **Lance** in behind. Bending the ball around the keeper the Frothers were level with minutes on the clock.

> 1-1

A couple of decent chances came for each side throughout the half, with **Ryan** making two good saves to keep the Frothers in it. **Lance** was unable to convert a similar opportunity to his earlier goal too.

A couple of formation change experiments didn't pay off as the Frothers were struggling to find options on attack.

A late opportunity to win the game came to **Jacob** who headed a corner into the bottom righthand side, but was cleared off the line.

## Man of the Match

**Jacob** with a really solid defensive game, an assist and almost the winner. Was lovely to watch.

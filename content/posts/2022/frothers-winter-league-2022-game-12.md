> Sweet as apple pie

The Frothers took on ESKA at Te Whaea on an almost perfect night for football.

The later-than-usual kickoff meant that the new daddies were dropping like flies, but a strong turnout plus the allure of knockout football bringing **Yarride** down meant there were a few subs.

The Frothers started the match with the upper hand. Levelling several good attacks the Frothers put the ball in the back of the net, but it was called back for an alleged foul in the box.

**Tyler** got his goal minutes later, however. The keeper made a risky call coming out to the edge of the box, allowing Tyler to turn back inside and shoot into an empty net.

> 1-0

The sun then went down, and so did the level of chat. An ESKA player resembling half Zlatan, half Sharapova, and all cock entered the game and promptly ended **Jack H**'s comeback. Kicking him in the same injured ankle to end his night.

The Frothers struggled to keep the rhythm going with the level of the light and the slickness of the pitch. ESKA were able to level through a counterattack in the middle of the park.

> 1-1

A couple of near chances, with **Jack K** having an effort put onto the bar, saw out the half.

## Halftime

The boys were determined to get back on top, with **Alain** frantically cashing in brownie points to buy another 10 minutes.

Getting going in the second half the lads were looking better. But some early confusion between defence and keeper lead to a coach killer, an attacker charging down a clearance and the rebound going in.

> 1-2

It was now late in the game and the boys needed to rally, and coach **Yarride** started to pull some strings. Putting **Chris** into the mids for the departed **Alain** to keep the bruiser appeal.

The Frothers managed to get back in it from a lovely bit of football. A cheeky back heel from your baby boy to **Jarrod** who spread the play to **Jamie** whose low cross was finished by **Tyler**.

> 2-2

The boys must have already been thinking about penalties, as a loosely marked ESKA player was able to take a pot shot from outside of the box to steal the lead in the dying minutes of the game.

> 2-3

But don't rule out the Frothers in knockout football.

A free kick in the Frothers half over the top led to a ball spilling out the side of the box. **Yarride**, who had been saving up his energy all match for this moment, dashed out to the ball first. The keeper, again going rush goalie, came flying out. Employing a little of the dark arts, **Yarride** turned a minor contact into a stonewall penalty.

**Taylor** stepped up for the Hattrick and sent the shot in off the post to establish dominance.

> 3-3

But the boys weren't finished. Like every Man U fan, the boys weren't interested in the current reality but instead wanted to relive the 1999 CL final.

The boys put ESKA's composure under the gun on the edge of their box. The defender's clearance could only find their first man and ricocheted back into the path of an on-running **Yarride**.

The man on a 6-month goal drought calmly put it to bed, sealing the win.

> 4-3

## Man of the Match

Quite a few nods for this award this week, but hard to go past the man that on his return from big daddy Rona bagged a Hattrick. **Tyler** continues to be the Frothers goal machine and style icon.

## Dick of the Day

In a rare turn of events, this award goes to an opposition player who embodied the award. Talking this much trash in a live knockout game is hubris at its best and befitting the award. Capped off by a truly anonymous performance by the Afghan hound.

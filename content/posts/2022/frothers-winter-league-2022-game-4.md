## Robbery at the playpen

Playing the first night game in a wee while and the Dads were dropping like flies, even the ref didn't show up. The boys were playing a fresh-faced Camaradas team with more pimples than pubes.

Something they did have going for them was a large fan turnout which was great to see! Sadly it was more Millwall than football and the fans turned to abuse rather than encouragement. Chat drier than **Charles Dailey**'s mouth after a Sunday sesh.

The Frothers started a bit sluggish but picked up their game throughout the first half. There were a lot of opportunities opening up when a few passes were strung together. The boys took the lead through a brilliant header over the keeper by **Tyler** off a pinpoint cross by **Evan**.

> 1-0

## Halftime

The crowd really started to get belligerent in the second half, making direct verbal attacks at players. Some of the boys were contemplating jail time to teach a little respect. Showing there is no justice these tactics paid off as two quick goals allowed Camaradas to take the lead.

> 1-2

Snapping back to it the Frothers put the foot down and started applying pressure. **Charles** had an effort off the outside of the boot come off the post.

**Lance** made a great run into the box and while still claiming a penalty **Tyler** snuck in to poke away his second.

> 2-2

The Camaradas were the team to take 3 points though, and made the most of a defensive slipup and scored the winner with 8 minutes left on the clock.

> 2-3

The game then turned ugly when they started time-wasting and trying to shithouse. However, they obviously have never learned the golden rule: don't shithouse a shithouser.

These boys are in for some drama this season.

## Man of the Match

Gotta be **Tyler**. In a game where the boys looked pretty flat, **Tyler** stood out with drive and two great goals.

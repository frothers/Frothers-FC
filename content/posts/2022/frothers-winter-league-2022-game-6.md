It has been a _Sign o’ the Times_ that this winter season is a different beast to the summer stroll we all enjoyed. It was lovely to welcome some of _The Beautiful Ones_ back to the _Revolution_ - always a pleasure and never a choir seeing **Angus Hay-Chapman**, **Jack Kos**, and **Jamie Bunting**.

Playing at our favoured ground of Te Whaea, the Frothers were ready to bring some _Purple Rain_ to an old enemy. We went straight for the dance floor off an early corner when **Evan** delivered to the most surprised person on the pitch **Alain**. With the ball missing about three people, a nice _Kiss_ off his boot from a meter out ended in glory. Showing the loyalty of Ryan Giggs towards his former brother(s), **Alain** was off celebrating like it was _1999._

Things were looking on the up but Blazers had other plans. A couple of their strikers and wingers hopped in a _Little Red Corvette_ and reminded the Frothers that _When Doves Cry,_ it pours, conceding 3 goals in probably as many minutes.

## **HALFTIME**

The second half started with a flier, **Lance** chasing down a _Raspberry Beret_ and cutting a delightful ball back to a man who couldn’t stop scoring if he tried, **Tyler**. The new guy truly giving us the feeling that _Nothin’ compares to you._

After a bit of commotion, there was no _Controversy_, and one of their defenders was sent. After a few close calls at either end, the Frothers were left clutching their _Diamonds and Pearls_ and coming up short. Football can be cruel but each player was coming away thinking _I Would Die 4 U._

Bring on next weekend and _Let’s Go Crazy!_

## **Man of the Match**

The real MVP - the kit man, **Chrissy Chester**.

## **Dick of the Day**

**Jack H** - for volunteering but more accurately we should be giving it to the opposition player formerly known as Joey Barton/Jack Grealish for axing the nicest guy on the pitch.

## Back at a reasonable hour against a more reasonable opposition.

The first half was dogged by a bit of classic Wellington wind, but it was nonetheless eventful. Tuscan earned themselves a penalty as the defender's nightmare **Hector** was brought down in the box. There was redemption in the air as **Ryan** chose the right side _again_ to keep it nill all. This lad really is a penalty specialist, definitely studying the tapes.

The Frothers also had a great chance go begging as two open shots on goal were scuffed.

## Halftime

The Frothers went from 3 subs to 1 with **Lance** leaving and **Evan** getting injured. But the Frothers had the wind with them and were feeling confident.

The Frothers started the half feeling good and began to push. The added confidence was their downfall though, as a backpass from **Chris** was intercepted and bundled home after a couple of attempts.

> 0-1

The Frothers weren't behind for long as **Alain** played a lovely ball over the top which **Tyler** bet the keeper to and chipped it high and with the wind to find the next.

> 1-1

The Raiders then started to play Hector-ball. This eventual paid dividends as he was found on the edge of the box and shot low into the corner.

> 1-2

**Jack** then also had to come off injured. This gave the impetus to try a bit of a change in positions.

It was almost two behind, however, as the 3 Tuskan raiders players waiting at the back post could only sky the ball over the bar from a cross.

This turned out to be costly when a ball in from **Jamie** wasn't properly dealt with and **Tyler** pounced, hitting an unstoppable volley off the weak foot.

> 2-2

The Frothers had the best of the last part of the game. **Jamie** intercepted a poor goal kick and had the whole net at his mercy, but dragged a shot well wide.

## Man of the match

**Tyler** grabbing back-to-back braces with two outrageous goals is hard to ignore.

## Dick of the day

**Jarrod** is going to pick this one up. Though there were a few moments from the Frothers where a bit of composure would have won us the match. Telling **Hector** to fuck-off on probably his least physical play brought some weird vibes ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

> The real Phoenix story

Playing a Habibis team that comfortably won the league last season the Frothers came into the game with a sense of foreboding following last week's results.

The stress started to tell as the Frothers started to have a go at their own players. And the Habibis capitalised and scored a scrappy first goal on the back of several mistakes.

> 0-1

The Frothers held on well for the majority of the half but were caught in possession and the Habibis scored a sweaty goal to go two up.

> 0-2

## Halftime

The boys regrouped at halftime and good vibes won out with a tactic of if they could get a goal we knew we were in with a shout.

Moving **Yarride** into CB, **Alain** up top and **Charles** in the mid paid dividends as the boys started to take control.

The breakthrough came from a **Yarride** freekick from wide into the sun which missed everybody and fell to an unmarked **Chris**. Dinking it over a diving keeper the ball crept over the line.

> 1-2

Feeling the momentum shift the boys started to play the game. Frustrating the Habibis who are known for their tempers it wasn't long until they started to turn on themselves and the ref.

Using this as a catalyst, a great passage of play saw passing right through the backline, midfield and forwards culminating in **Charles** finding **Alain** who drove a hard shot through the Keeper.

> 2-2

The boys were tiring but a couple of chances came at the end. **Lance** was bundled over on the edge of the box but the freekick could only sail over the bar.

## Man of the Match

Playing in the unfamiliar RB position, **Milan** really took the position into his own. After a bit of a shaky start, he performed excellent defensive work to keep the wing quiet. Especially in the second half where most of their attack was coming down the left.

On the attack, there were a few saucy pullbacks ðŸ¥µðŸ’¦ out of the blue to keep possession and emasculate the opposition.

## Dick of the Day

**Alain** got lost in the sauce a bit in the first half and started directing his anger toward the baby boys. He did manage to turn it around with a great second half display though...

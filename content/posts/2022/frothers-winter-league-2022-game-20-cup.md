## Father's Day Energy

Back in the cup competition and with a point to provide the Frothers were back to playing in Wellington Central after weeks in P town. Playing on Father's day the boys were repping 5 daddies who were still digesting their brunch.

The opportunity to make their 3rd final on the trot was too good an opportunity and the boys came out of the woodwork to have a 15-man squad.

The toss was a defining moment in the match, with a strong wind and glaring sunlight **Chris**, with the advice of an uninjured **Tavis** elected to start against the wind.

It was a hard slog in the first half, as the ball got stuck underfoot and aerial balls were ineffective.

The Frothers were holding their own well and, though only creating a few chances weren't under too much pressure themselves.

The first moment of consequence came when the ref, making up his own definition of the handball law, decided that the Pelicans deserved a penalty. **Ryan** knew this couldn't stand and saved big daddy **Chris'** blushes by saving his 17th penalty of the season.

However, only moments later the Frothers defence were caught in possession and a quick finish to the near-post gave the Pelicans the lead

> 0-1

Again the Pelicans pressured the Frother's defence and again a mistake was forced. This time the pelicans player was able to finish a nice shot from the edge of the box.

> 0-2

Dropping **Charles** into CB the boys had to solidify things and hold the scoreline till Halftime.

## Halftime

Knowing that this was a five-goal wind the boys weren't too disheartened at halftime. There was a lot of football to play.

Coming out strong in the second half it only took a minute for the boys to get back in it. **Bunting** got on the end of a good spell of play from the Frothers and decided to let one loose from outside the box. Slipping on contact the ball went into goalkeeper noman's land, just too far to stop with the feet but too close to dive.

> 1-2

The boys were sensing blood now. Having all the possession and putting pressure on every part of the opposition's play it was a question of when. After several back-to-back corners, the forbidden combination of **Evan** to **Chris** finally occurred. A high header from the centre of the box looped over the keeper and into the net.

> 2-2

The Pelicans were on full tilt now, and one of their players decided it was a good time to go in for a late challenge. Worthy of a yellow, the decided red was the colour de jour.

It should have been all Frothers from here, but calamity stuck again. In seemingly the only time they got into the box **Angus** threw down a trademark slide tackle. Catching the ball against the man it appeared to some that he had completely missed the ball. The ref called it a penalty much to the astonishment of the Frothers defence. **Milan**, accustomed to threatening the refs at Red Star games, gave the ref a lesson in direct hostility. Not taking too kindly to this the ref gave him a yellow, thought about it, and then changed it to a red.

**Ryan** was unable to repeat his heroics on this penalty.

> 2-3

Losing the lead and the man-up advantage it would have been easy for the Frothers to lose heart. However, they regrouped with 3 at the back and got on the attack again with 13 minutes to play.

This paid off almost directly afterwards, as after challenging for every ball the Frothers had shot cleared off the line, but only as far as **Tavis** who was able to bundle it over to level the game up.

> 3-3

Knowing there was still time on the clock and being firmly in control of the football the Frothers pushed for a winner. It wasn't long before **Lance** was played in, whose first touch took him clear of the defence and a well hit left footed shot found the back of the net.

> 4-3

In the dying stages of the game the Frothers got their first goal kick of the half. Forgetting the wind had changed the Pelicans defenders were sitting past halfway. Seeing this **Chris** was able to send the kick over them for **Lance** to run onto. Putting the ball around the keeper and the match out of doubt.

> 5-3

## Man of the Match

Some great performances to turn this one around. **Ryan** with some great saves and the peno, **Lance** with the two late goals. **Evan** baiting another red card.

This week it goes to **Chris**, a clean goal off a corner, an assist and 1 minute on the bench. Big Game Player.

## Dick of the Day

This one picks itself. **Milan** risking it all to let off a bit of steam from his first year of fatherhood. Wasn't even a good insult. "Fuck you ref"

## Special Mentions

### Lance - 100 Games

What a day for the director of football, **Lance**. 2 decisive goals, first Father's day, and 100 caps. Frother's step-over king has been in sizzling form and joins an elite club of centurions.

## Father's Day Energy

Back in the cup competition and with a point to provide the Frothers were back to playing in Wellington Central after weeks in P town. Playing on Father's day the boys were repping 5 daddies who were still digesting their brunch.

The opportunity to make their 3rd final on the trot was too good an opportunity and the boys came out of the woodwork to have a 15-man squad.

The toss was a defining moment in the match, with a strong wind and glaring sunlight **Chris**, with the advice of an uninjured **Tavis** elected to start against the wind.

It was a hard slog in the first half, as the ball got stuck underfoot and aerial balls were ineffective.

The Frothers were holding their own well and, though only creating a few chances weren't under too much pressure themselves.

The first moment of consequence came when the ref, making up his own definition of the handball law, decided that the Pelicans deserved a penalty. **Ryan** knew this couldn't stand and saved big daddy **Chris'** blushes by saving his 17th penalty of the season.

However, only moments later the Frothers defence were caught in possession and a quick finish to the near-post gave the Pelicans the lead

> 0-1

Again the Pelicans pressured the Frother's defence and again a mistake was forced. This time the pelicans player was able to finish a nice shot from the edge of the box.

> 0-2

Dropping **Charles** into CB the boys had to solidify things and hold the scoreline till Halftime.

## Halftime

Knowing that this was a five-goal wind the boys weren't too disheartened at halftime. There was a lot of football to play.

Coming out strong in the second half it only took a minute for the boys to get back in it. **Bunting** got on the end of a good spell of play from the Frothers and decided to let one loose from outside the box. Slipping on contact the ball went into goalkeeper noman's land, just too far to stop with the feet but too close to dive.

> 1-2

The boys were sensing blood now. Having all the possession and putting pressure on every part of the opposition's play it was a question of when. After several back-to-back corners, the forbidden combination of **Evan** to **Chris** finally occurred. A high header from the centre of the box looped over the keeper and into the net.

> 2-2

The Pelicans were on full tilt now, and one of their players decided it was a good time to go in for a late challenge. Worthy of a yellow, the decided red was the colour de jour.

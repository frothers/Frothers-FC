## Thrilla in Manila

The boys were treated to some blood sports before the game, well those who showed up on time were. In the match before there was a dust-up after a late challenge resulted in a sucker punch and then a good old bit of personal assault as the goalkeeper wanted to get a hand on the ball.

## Onto the Football

The boys are now playing non-stop at Ascott it appears. Don't even worry about them photos then.

The Frothers definitely had the better of the first half 15 minutes but couldn't quite weight the final passes on a slipper windy afternoon.

The Black bulls started to take the upper hand with possession, but it was to be their undoing as their centre-back got cute with the ball and got his pocket picked by **Tyler.** Driving onto goal Tyler held off the challenges and was able to slot a shot around the keeper

> 1-0

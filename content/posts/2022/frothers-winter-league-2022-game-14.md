> Got the mojo back.

Another weekend back at Fraser Park and another match against Valley Dream. Having played Valley 5 times in the last year we knew we were up for a solid contest.

The first real chance of the Match came to **Nick**, who, on this Century for the club, struck the crossbar. The ball bounced down with some calls saying it went over the line.

Not long after the first goal did come. **Tyler** drove up the middle and then disguised a through ball through to **Lance**. Taking what felt like an embarrassment of touches in the box, **Lance** finished without fuss into the keeper's right.

> 1-0

The all New Plymouth front line kept the good thing going with another goal, this time with switched roles. **Lance** played **Tyler** in who did what he had been threatening for a few weeks and chipped the diving keeper.

> 2-0

## Halftime

The wind picked up in the second half, and that heralded some classic bang-it-long football.

In a half relatively devoid of chances **Evan** came closest with a whipped-in corner that came off the crossbar, and a freekick that went narrowly over.

That's 4 clean-sheets in a row against Valley, 6 hours of football. ðŸ”’

## Man of the Match

**Lance** was getting crazy FOMO missing the Frother's season turnaround. On relatively little sleep he came out the gates and was a constant threat and fan favourite.

## Dick of the Day

The man with the sweetest double pump fake in the team. **Milan** looking like he was about to drop the ultimate clutch game 6 championship bucket of a foul throw. Flexing.

Battles between brothers always have an extra edge to them and the **Sule** boys going at each other this weekend was no different. Throwing themselves at each other for 90 minutes, there were shades of Mufasa and Scar taking their sibling rivalry to new levels at Pride Rock in 1994.

Forced out of their beloved purple and made to play at their least favourite ground, the Frothers were going to need some Disney magic to upset the division champions. The loss of big daddy **Mufasa Chester** is always heartbreaking no matter how many times you’ve seen it before but the Frothers were up for this one and started with the wind at their backs.

Fittingly it was **Yarride** who opened it up, latching on to a bad pass and beating the keeper near post, in his final game before going back to Gizzy to start his own pride. The CIRCLE OF LIFE continues. 

> 1-0

The Frothers were serving up lessons all over the place with dominant play. However, the goalmouth proved to be a shadowland that was not to be touched as many chances went just wide. A skewed clearance that was surprisingly called a back pass resulted in a free kick from 2 yards out. With **Lance** away and **Yarride** on the sideline, **Tyler** saw his chance to call seniority and take it himself. The kid JUST CANT WAIT TO BE KING. His blocked effort found its way back to **Sule** who shot over the bar.

## 1-0 at halftime.

 As with the greatest movie ever made, the first half was a whimsical, family-friendly outing for the Frothers. Things took a dark turn in the second half though with the clouds coming over and a heated Mark Ave having the wind in their favour. The boys in blue had to BE PREPARED for **Will Scar** and his pack of hyenas to attack.

Another questionable back pass call to even things up, as a well floated into the box and a powerful header had it level at one apiece.

> 1-1

A sudden torrential downpour and boys were scampering away to save their belongings before the game resumed with the Frothers’ spirit at an all-time low. And then the part in the story where all of a sudden things randomly change for the better and you forget all your worries. The rain stopped, the football improved and chances started coming. Sometimes all you need in footy is a bit of HAKUNA MATATA.

**Yarride** was able to find the go-ahead goal after link-up play with **Charles** which was almost as nice as the date night the two spent at Rosie’s a couple of hours later. You could FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT.

> 2-0

The climax of the game saw the Frothers finally defeat the foe, a quick counter-attack and **Yarride** was able to set up **Tyler** for his weekly goal.

> 3-0

Special mention to the older **Sule**, stepping up and making us all Remember Him. Also **Angus** and **Jack** in the back, a pairing as good as Timon and Pumba, the real heroes of the day. As the sun may have set on **Yarride’s** Frothers career, he was able to walk off a king. Not in any way a great king, more like a Ledley King. But he’ll take it.

Football on the day of the Champions League final is always destined to draw comparisons, however, 11 goals flowing in Wellington was in stark contrast to the 1-0 in Paris.

Both games did start late as North Wellington only had 9 players to start. They were the first to score as they took advantage of the COVID lungs loophole in defence.

> 0-1

The Frothers levelled after a good passage of passing found **Evan** all alone on the edge of the box. Careful not to overdo it he shot it just to the keeper's left and under.

> 1-1

The Frothers then managed to take the lead as one of the North Wellington players had been watching the NBA finals rather than the football. He tried moving off the ball screen in the box which resulted in Evan taking a hit to the face.

The resultant penalty was taken by **Evan**, who sent the keeper the wrong way.

> 2-1

North Wellington then got a penalty of their own as **Jacob** brushed by the brick shithouse they have upfront and nearly ended his career by the look of it.

**Ryan** could only watch the ball go to his right.

> 2-2

North Wellington then got 11 men on the pitch and scored another.

> 2-3

## Halftime

Sadly, the foul on **Evan** ruled him out of the game.

North Wellington went on to score one or two more goals.

> 8-2

**Jarrod** scored a late consultation goal after being put one on one with the keeper out wide.

> 8-3

## Man of the Match

**Evan,** with one half and two goals. Backing up an excellent showing in the quiz the night before. Really missed him when he came off

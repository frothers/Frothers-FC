> At least it wasn't raining this week

Playing a Black Bulls team that always seem to save their best for the Frothers it was time to test the hoodoo of Ascott Park. Maybe we would get a break with some more of the boys living in the hood.

Bringing Big Roach Energy, seemingly every player on the Bulls team was 5' 8", fast, and could dribble.

The Frothers really battled to get passes to stick in the first half. On the back of one of these missed passes, the Bulls were able to counter and some slick one-twos got them one-on-one with **Ryan**, whom they also dribbled around.

> 0-1

## Halftime

The Frothers knew that the second half was their time to shine.

Tyler sent an early header just wide off a corner.

The Bulls somehow were the next to score, keeping in a ball the Frothers had given up on and then shooting through **Ryan's** legs

> 0-2

The boys decided it was time to play to their strengths, the extra kgs we were pulling around. In short, the man-or-ball technique was instated.

This paid off pretty quickly as **Lance** was able to make inroads down the wing and send a good cross into **Tyler**, whose first header was saved by the keeper, but the follow-up found the net. No assist for **Lance**.

> 1-2

You have to give it to them, weighing 65 kgs soaking wet, the Bulls didn't pull out of any 50/50s. This did mean they were eating a lot of shit though as the Frothers flew through the challenges.

Taking exception to this, and the slightly relaxed stance the ref had of these, one of the Bulls players lashed out at **Evan** with a knee-high challenge on the ground. The Ref then rewarded this act of petulance with a red card.

It was a relentless tirade of Frother attacks from then, with another yellow card or two being given to the Bulls. **Tyler** can desperately close again, hitting the keeper and having the ball come off the crossbar.

The Bulls managed to hold on.

## Man of the Match

**Tyler** starting up that scoring run again.

## Dick of the Day

**Milan** saved my blushes after wasting two good freekick opportunities by yelling at **Charles** when dribbling into the attacking third. **Charles**, who found himself on the wing couldn't help but call for the ball like he was being left out of a round. The resulting retort from **Milan** about "Having so much time in the middle" was made all the funnier by the fact he was dispossessed.

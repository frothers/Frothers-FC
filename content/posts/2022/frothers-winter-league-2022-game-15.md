The boys were their own worst enemies on this one. Starting the game with 10 men the Frothers were out of sorts from the kickoff. Charles made it after a couple of minutes to get XI on the field, but there was still confusion a-plenty.

GoTI took advance of the chaos by bombing aerial through balls for their striker to run onto. The striker made two surprisingly good finishes with these opportunities in the first half.

> 0-2

## Halftime

An inquiry led to some positional changes and the boys were back to it.

A lot better football and a few opportunities later the Frothers were making looking a lot more competitive.

Another long ball led to a third got GoTi.

> 0-3

The Frothers managed to convert their pressure, by the way of a penalty. **Tyler** won it and grabbed the ball to take it. Hitting it into the top of the net with confidence to keep the ratio up. No consideration for the occasion, though ðŸ˜¢.

> 1-3

## Man of the Match

No votes, so it goes to **Charles** for making it back for the match he said he couldn't make. Also, he must have passed me the ball at least 10 times over the match. Unreal.

## Dick of the Day

**Jack Hayden** for DotD for the foul throw and dressing down by his old mate the referee.

It was off to Ascott Park to take on ESKA who the Frothers just pipped in the last time we played. A couple of familiar-faced ring-ins were required to make the numbers.

Yet another windy and slightly rainy day saw the Frothers struggling to make an XI for the game before **Angus** came in tops with the ring-ins.

The boys struggled to make passes meet in the first half and couldn't quite get going.

## Second half

The wind died down and it was actually nice to play at Ascott Park for once. The breakthrough came through **Sule** who was able to cut back inside and unleash a shot from outside the box that had the keeper flapping.

> 1-0

This was precisely what the Frothers were in need of and turned up the juice. Dominating in all areas of the park, the boys' confidence grew almost arrogant. **Lance**, playing as an outright centre-forward, took a delicious touch in the box to set himself up for a quality goal.

> 2-0

The Frother's attacks were relentless and **Lance** was playing like an absolute demon up top. It wasn't long before he added himself a second with an assist from **Sule**.

> 3-0

He could have easily had his hat-trick had it not been for some dubious refereeing calling an offside.

The Frothers were pressing again and again in the opposition box. This time **Charles** found himself with the ball. Losing track of the ball it looked like the danger might pass, but the opposition defender decided that **Charles** was too dangerous to live and went straight through him.

> Penalty

A real toss-up here of who should take the penalty. **Charles** on his 100th game and winning it, or **Nick** on his final game for the Frothers.

This was a real win-win scenario for the spectators.

**Nicky** somehow convinced **Charles** to let him have it and produced an effort fit for the occasion, a tame shot down the middle that the keeper could easily parry ðŸ¥§.

## Man of the Match

Honourable mention goals to **Angus** who was rock solid all game with a couple of trademark big slide tackles. The award goes to the man just back from illness, **Lance,** who played out of his skin. Some of the touches were like prime Bergkamp. A couple of goals to top things off.

## Dick of the Day

Fitting that in his last match he picks up the award. **Nick** gets it for missing the penalty and leaving the boys. A minor redemption piece was when Nick kicked shit Haaland when the ball went out. Gonna miss you, bud.

## Special Mention

100 games for that guy, **Charles**. The big number 4 and midfield operator is the definition of evergreen.

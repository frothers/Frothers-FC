Frothers FC continued to struggle to get into second gear coming up against the Ball Tamperers in Week ~~5~~7 of the 2022 Winter WSFL. 

The game kicked off with a handful of half-chances for the boys to take an early lead but which were unable to be converted. It was then a soft penalty for what appeared to be a clean shoulder to shoulder challenge that broke the deadlock. Frothers FC felt quietly confident that **Ryan** might continue to defy all odds and reproduce another of his trademark penalty saves, but the coin had been flipped too many times.

> 0-1

Half time came too soon and feeling hard done by with a 0-1 scoreline. With both some soft turn overs and some slick passages of play, the Frothers were running hot and cold until one of those passages of play pulled through with a nice ball down the line being cut back into a half shot half cross that was forced past the opposing keeper. Goal-line technology was needed to confirm but the ref pointed to the halfway line and it was given. 

> 1-1

A lofted corner floated into the danger zone gave the Ball Tamps the lead when an unfortunate clearance ended up with the ball in the Frothers own net. On a day where the opposition seemed surely beatable, the Frothers were unable to find the spark in the final third to bring the points home.

> 1-2

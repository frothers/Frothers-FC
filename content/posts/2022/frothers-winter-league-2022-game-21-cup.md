## Another shot at the cup

Last game of the season and it is a third straight year of making it to the plate final.

The controversy was already underway as the Sule brothers who represented the Frothers last year were to compete against them this year.

This also marked a rallying of the troops, with a bumper squad of 16 Frothers answering the call. Was the reason Finals footy? Last game of the season? A game before 5 pm? You decide.

## First Half

The Frothers started into the wind again in an attempt to replicate the game plan of the semifinals. It meant a hard first-half of through balls to the young lads from Mark Ave.

The first real chance of the game came to **Jarrod**, whose shot could only find the outside of the upright. Mark Ave followed this up with a decent penalty shout as **Will** felt contact in the box, but it was waved away.

Mark Ave then got on their bikes. Will was played in down the right and a low cross found Byron Bay Hatch at the back post.

> 0-1

The goal put the Frothers on tilt and only a couple of minutes later **Sule** was found on the edge of the box after some careless possession. An outside of the boot shot found the corner with disgusting ease.

> 0-2

The Frothers made some subs and regained some composure for the rest of the half.

## Halftime

The boys weren't out of this yet and knew there were goals to be had.

After several minutes of more stalemates, the long goal kick again proved the easiest avenue. Winning the initial header-on the Frothers were able to press and Jacob was through on goal. Using his first touch to chip the keeper he was able to bundle it home to get the Frothers back within a goal.

> 1-2

The next goal came the way of Mark Ave. **Sule** had a ricocheted ball hit **Chris** in the arm. Taking the call not being given as a personal insult he ran hard and forced the error. Mark Ave were then able to break down the wing and score from another low cross.

> 3-1

Just as things began to look settled the Frothers were granted a lifeline. A cross from **Jarrod** was too close to the keeper, but he let it slip through his hands. Johnny on the spot, **Evan** was able to poke the ball home.

> 2-3

The Frothers started pouring forwards to try to find a winner in the dying stages. Several chances passed by and the Frothers committed more and more to each attack. On what would be the last play for the game this proved to be the undoing, as **Will** picked up the ball at halfway and was able to play in the Marks Ave player for the decisive goal.

> 2-4

## Man of the Match

**Jacob** had to weather a storm down the left side in the first half and then popped up with a goal when playing further up the pitch.

## Dick of the day

Tyler, for kicking the ball away then we won a free kick and were behind. As mindless as the sacking of Tuchel. Sources report he was also asking for the head of the Frothers manager after the match.

# End of Season

A marathon season for the Frothers. With 5 new babies, 4 rookies, 6 centurions, a summer title, a mid-season relegation, 21 games, and 0 remaining brownie points the Frothers take a break until next winter.

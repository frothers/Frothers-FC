We had our very own Geoff Shreeves sideline reporter in **Jamie Hatch** this week.

## Kick off

dTen in, both sides had a couple of half-chances. We are Definitely looking like the better team so far.

A break down the right by harry finds **Jarrod** open at far post but it’s put wide

The first corner of the game is a good ball in from **Harry** that **Jacob** connects with on the header. Unfortunately is cleared off the line by a defending header.

They get a decent break away off a through ball. **Ryan** clears it out with an impressive slide a few meters outside the box.

Big break away by the opposition with the numerical advantage but **Ryan** handles a poor cross with ease.

A ball far to **Charles** is eventually chased down and after a few passes makes it way wide to **Jarrod** at the far post. A move inside is finished with the left that just sneaks in the corner

> 1-0

**Bunting** wins a 50/50 that he then fed through to **Chris** with a good angled run. Passed wide to **Jarrod** and a strong cross through the middle isn’t touched by either team

They get yet another fast break from halfway. **Angus** slides well and clears it to the line.

Another shot on target by **Chris**. Surely one’s going to find the net soon

Evan subs in and has an immediate impact finding **Tavis** on the far right. The cross in is headered wide by the defence to harry who sends one in. The ball ends at **Jacobs's** feet and he spanks it home

> 2-0

Another goal by the old man.

A lofted shot from well out is bundled by the keeper into the net. Was an easy save to make but still counts the same on the score sheet.

> 3-0

“Nill all intensity lads” classic shout from **Charles** while standing around waiting for a throw-in

## Half time 3-0.

The second half has kicked off. Some saying it’s a four goal wind so all to play for

An early chance after a through ball by **Evan** at halfway. **Harry** is chased down and nothing eventuates.

A couple of early shots on target. **Evan** hits one low but is cleared off by the defender on the post

Some great passing down the right side ends with a **Jacob** cross-in. Cleared by the keeper

Back-to-back shots by Knyaw. Trying the Frother's defence with some slick moves

Back-to-back crosses in from the Frothers but no one can get a good touch to them

A slow shot from harry nearly makes it through the keeper's legs. He’s looking shotty out here today, think **Charles**’ goal really rocked his confidence.

Another fast break from **Jarrod**, he’s dicing them. Can’t connect with **Harry** in the mix though unfortunately

Some great play by the Frothers. A one-two overlap by **Charles** and **Evan** leads to an easy cross into **Jarrod** at far post. After the touch, it’s fired into the defender

**Jarrod** goes down just outside the box. **Charles** looks to the sideline with a wink wanting the free-kick for himself. **Evan** steps up though and smashes it wide

A rare recent shot from the opposition but nothing comes of it

Frothers pulling on the pressure at the moment. A great ball in from **Tavis** and **Jarrod** misses it entirely

**Jarrod** was taken down in the box. Not a dirty tackle but definitely a foul

Another chance from **Jarrod**. He’s getting a lot today, but it’s sent into the hockey pitch

More shots from the Frothers. Stat sheet going to be stacked this game. **Bunting** with the one-on-one but it’s kicked straight at the keeper

Quick redemption though as he scores. I was too busy retrieving the ball so didn’t see it. Frothers 

> 5-0

Jarrods everywhere. Very similar 50/50, headered over the keeper at the 18 yard. Side by side sprint against a defender who does a shit attempt at a clearance. So bad it’s good though as Jarrod can’t control it and it’s out for a goal kick

Jarrod chips the keeper for a hatty but it’s called offside. The refs missed a defender who was holding his dick on the 6 yard box. Realises the error and gives a drop ball. Not going to help Jarrod sleep tonight

Chris glances a header just over the cross bar wrapping up a dominant frother spell.

Full time, 5-0 end to end win

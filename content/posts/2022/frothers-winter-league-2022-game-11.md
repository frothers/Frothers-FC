> The boys are really missing the paparazzi

Playing the team with the second-best purple kit in the league, the Frothers were desperate to get some more points on the board.

On a slippery Sunday evening at Wellington College, the boys were back in blue and trying to turn around the last couple of results. Second-time baby daddy **Alain** was back in the squad to bring an additional bit of quality in attack. **Angus** and **Sule** also came out of the wilderness to bring some much-needed stability to the lineup.

The first half had no goals but a lot to talk about.

**Lance** was forced off early through injury on the back of a bad challenge. This was especially hard to swallow due to the new homeowner looking really dangerous.

A couple of excellent saves from **Ryan** kept the Frothers in the game. A stray ball landed at the feet of a Mark Ave player at the back post, but Ryan made himself big.

A travesty of a call proceeded, as **Harry** took the ball down on the back post, cut inside and finished, but was adjudged to be offside on a deep sitting defence.. the spectators couldn't believe their eyes.

## Halftime

The Frothers came out in the second half with some fresh energy and a determination to avenge the wrongs of the first half. The Frothers conceded with only minutes on the clock after a great floated ball from outside the box found a Mark Ave player at the back post who finished first-time.

> 0-1

It didn't take long until the Frothers levelled through the most unlikely of sources. A freekick was won on the edge of the box and **Charles** stepped up. Curling a shot into the corner of the goal the keeper could only swat at the shot.

> 1-1

The Frothers were really solid for the rest of the half, with a lot of good link-up play and providing options for each other. A particularly nice run saw **Bunting** wind back the years and pull out some hot stepping down the left-wing.

There was one slip-up as who Frothers players went for the same ball and then both pulled out, allowing Mark Ave to counter. The striker was able to break the line and round the keeper to put them in front.

> 1-2

Pouring on the pressure, the Frothers pushed hard for an equaliser but again were unable to make the sustained pressure count.

## Man of the Match

**Charles** popping up for his first goal of the year was a pleasure to see. Suddenly every set piece had **Charles** standing over the ball. A couple of nice corners were sent in too.

## Dick of the Day

Pretty good showing from the boys today.

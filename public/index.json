If you listen hard you can still hear the cry of \u0026ldquo;Over\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the other notable chance of the first half, a header from Sule was cleared off the line.\nSecond half Another tight half.

This week it was by Jack.\nMaking it hard for ourselves The game kicked off without any particular inspiring play from either side. A match that was a cagey affair last year looked destined to be heading the same way as the Frothers couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to make the right decisions with the ball.\nAfter pinning Bond Sports Bar back in their half for a large period of play the breakthrough finally came when Sule burst through and slotted home.\n 1-0\n Thinking the game was ready for a bit more possession football, the Frother started trying to string together a few more passes and play through the backline a bit more. This didn\u0026rsquo;t work out so well this time as a misplaced pass between the centre backs allowed a Bonds striker to run through onto goal and put the ball past\n 1-1\n Now that\u0026rsquo;s football Not letting the goal conceded get them down, the Frothers continued to put on a passing performance. This time it paid off as several nice passes were put together, stretching the opposition backline and resulting in Evan running onto a ball on the edge of the box and putting a first-time finish past the keeper. Breaking his yearlong goal drought.\n 2-1\n Half-time Going into the break up was a big boost for the boys. They were so excited to start the second half Jack forgot to put his gloves on, resulting in the kickoff having to be taken again.\nThe second half started off with a couple of missed chances from the Frother, albeit one being from Charles. One man who didn\u0026rsquo;t miss out was Lance, who scored his first goal of the campaign to give the boys a buffer.\n 3-1\n He was only 2 metres inside\u0026hellip; Desperate to get back in the game Bonds started pushing their midfielders forward more. This paid off as one of their midfielders was able to make a late run into the box before being brought down by Sam.\nThe resulting penalty was put rather unconvincingly to the wrong side of the keeper and Bonds had a sniff.\n 3-2\n But the lads kept em out.\nMan of the Match A huge display from Lance, both scoring and performing great hold-up play\nDick of the Day Sam for turning up late because he has to go back home to grab his socks.

Good passing and running off the ball left the Frothers backline in disarray and lead to the first goal of the game.\n 0-1\n Not wanting to leave it too long before a replay the Frothers put pressure on Los Blazeros' backline, forcing an error. Yarride calmly slotting home after been given the ball on the edge of the box. Jamie then tried to claim a key pass to their backline initially\u0026hellip;. Not quite sure about that one.\n 1-1\n The game stalled there for a while as neither team could take the upper hand in the midfield. The Frothers both being far too soft and giving away too many fouls in the middle of the park.\nIt was the former which lead to the breakthrough for the Blazeros, where a midfielder was able to stroll through the midfield almost unopposed before doing a one-two to get a one-on-one which they calmly finished.\n 1-2\n Inquiry After a half where the Frothers never really got into gear, the boys needed to regroup. Words of encouragement (and some thinly veiled threats) were shared. It was time to turn it on.\nWhether it was the speeches or the change in direction of the wind, there was an immediate improvement in the quality of the football being played.\nHarry Kane Would be Proud After several promising looking attacks the breakthrough came through a bit of gamesmanship. Yarride, dispossessing a defender on the edge of the box, dashed into the box. Knowing the defender would be desperate to make amends Yarride folded under the first sign of contact. After taking 10 seconds to decide that a soft foul is still a foul the ref awarded the penalty.\nThe keeper tried to psyche out Yarride by doing a few body feints, so Yarride went with the tried and true of just hitting hard slightly off centre.\n 2-2\n Open the flood gates With the game back on level terms, the Frothers started to turn up the pressure. Every attack had teeth and the opposition couldn\u0026rsquo;t find respite anywhere on the pitch. Sule buried a goal not too long after and the boys were ahead.\n 3-2\n Yarride then had an eternity of time to pick his spot as Lance and Sule passed the ball across the top of the opposition box, taking the whole backline out of the equation.\n 4-2\n Sule then rounded the keeper (for the second time) and this time made sure of it to extend the lead.\n 5-2\n Not to be outdone, Yarride also rounded the keeper and finished from a tight angle off the left to get his fourth.\n 6-2\n Man of the Match Frother\u0026rsquo;s baby daddy Chris for enforcing the stranglehold in the second half.\nDick of the Day Also Chris, for going for goal off a 45-yard free-kick and sending it deep into the stands, and getting too real with the encouragement.

The Frothers were struggling to find their rhythm for the first part of the game.\nPretty good hit, really The breakthrough came through a great hit from the Valley FC striker. After a questionable clearance from an unnamed Frothers player, a thunderbolt took Ryan out of the game.\n 0-1\n Return of the divine The goal was just what the Frothers needed to get into the swing of things. Several good chances then came, with Sule, Jack, and Jamie coming close. The corner following one of these chances was just the opportunity an old friend of the Frothers needed. OG laid his divine touch on a flick on by Sule to level the game up.\n 1-1\n Halftime Geed up by the positive end to the half the Frothers came out with thirst in the second half, but it was Valley FC who came out stronger.

Lance following in appeared to have an easy tap in, but in an act of pure friendship tried to just follow the shot in. The goalie managed to get back in time, and the following scraps were jumped on by Yarride to bury it, finally.\n 2-1\n Hold on With the light fading, the Frothers decided to set up to hold what they had.

Backing up his one from preseason. Unbelievable.\nBacks it up Not too long afterwards another goal from a cross came for the new man. Harry controlling a long ball that looked destined to be blown out for a goal kick. Beating his man, Harry delivered a great cross that Sule calmly finished.\nDenied from the line, twice Yarride, worried about his golden boot, started to step it up. Twice beating the keeper on the edge of the box only to have the ball cleared off the line.\nSecond half The second half started and it was straight to Frothers football again. The field really started opening up as the Pelicans pushed for a goal, however, the balls over the top kept drifting through harmlessly to Ryan.\nFinally gets his goal All this extra space is just what the doctor ordered for Yarride, as charging through he again got the keeper off his line. Making no mistake this time he buried it in the top corner.\nOh and another 3 With the game well and truly open now the goals began to rain. Yarride scoring another, before Sule completed his hattrick off the back of a Jamie strike off the upright.

Like a young antelope wandering into the deep waters of the lagoon, Yarride tried something cute and was set upon by the opposition crocodiles strikers. After the ball quickly came into the box, Nick, as on one of his tinder dates, laid it on a bit strong and it all went wrong. The ref called for a penalty and Alain stepped up and converted it.\nShortly after Alain shot from outside of the box to level it up.

Frothers were dominating possession and attacking at will down each wing. Harry Furnish broke through and had a curling effort go just wide.\n Check the facts, expose those cats\n Time and again the Frothers exposed frailties in their backline, with the killer blow happening when a through-ball from the foot of sweet baby boy Stu Escott cut midfield and backline apart to find his opposite winder, Jamie Hatch. The J man, not falling for the ignore the ball bluff by the defence, tucked the ball deep in the old onion bag.\n Get up\nJust like that\n In a team dripping with defensive prowess, the big hoser himself, Charles Daily, was pushed up into midfield. Lance then was put through on goal. He did that Lance thing. The ball poped out to Nick on the wing to headed it to the wide-open Charles Daily. One touch and boom, right off the defenders back and into the back of the net. 2-0.\n Get up\nJust like that\n By this stage it was really pouring down, and halftime came around.\nAfter a quick break, all the boys were back on the field and ready to go. All except the referee. In a shameful display, the ref (I can only assume) had to go knock one out at the break. Resulting in the Frothers losing their momentum the time he returned.\n Of course endorsed while consciousness faded\n The Frothers were then up against it for the full second half. Having lost momentum and the wind and the rain coming fast the boys had to try hold on for dear life. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too long until Valley broke through with a darting run and cross combo.\nTheir second came after several fantastic stops by Ryan, wiping out the old viper arm to save a very good stop. Dreaming about his post-game steinlager, a ball snuck between his legs to make it two-all.\n Desecrated while the coroner waited\n The Frothers began to come back into the game at this point, Luke had a couple of efforts off the left go just wide, one clipping the bar.\nThe ref was also showing that even though he brought his body back on the pitch he left his mind in cyberspace. Showing the abstinence worthy of a saint when it came to blowing the whistle.\nValley then got their third to take the game..\n Show no love so its easy to hate it\n However, it was a great showing from the Frothers against a very strong team.

Sadly this has been patched and Jamie could only find the side netting.\n It\u0026rsquo;s not in the way you say you care\n Half time came about with both the wind and the sun with the Frothers for the second half.

With the goal gaping he cut inside like R9, only to try a spicy one-two with the corner flag from distance, which would have made Andy Carroll look good. Not to be outdone by a Liverpool fan, Molyneaux soon snatched at a chance of his own when he had more time to burn than Fergie in stoppage, but lifted over the bar.\nThings soon went from bad to worse for the Froth, when the Sudakas' striker hit another high-arcing rainbow, teeing up the wind for its second goal of the game. With a two goal margin snagged, the opposition started to get both cocky and mouthy (never a good combo). After some whispered bating by R9 and a few talking-to’s from the ref, they almost came unstuck when they tried to spring the off side trap from their own half.\nThe younger Rosario (CR7) was quickly onto it and through on goal, but with the Hatch wide open to his left, he went for the typical Ronnie glory and failed to find the hole between the keepers legs who pulled off a nifty save with his feet. The final action of a whirlwind first period, culminated in Molyneaux being hacked down inside the area as he went to pull the trigger - but the ref was having none of it.\nHalf Time - Wind 2, Frothers 0\u0026hellip;\nHeartened by their slew of missed chances, the Frother’s emerged for the second half changed men. Captain for the day Hanson continued to battle harder than his namesake Alan with a man of the match display, and Milan was more AC’s Pirlo than a head-down Baros in holding down the midfield.\nWith the central areas bossed and Sudakas tiring, the Froth started to turn the screw. A long ball over the top found CR7 Rosario running through unchecked and he released an unstoppable Ronnie rocket into the top corner, which left injury prone Chester Matip screaming baby girl!\nNot long after, Ronnie was in again this time with a wonky cross that had the goalie flapping under his own bar and gave R9 Rosario the chance to throw his hard earned weight around and equalise with a torpedo of a header. With Jack Van Diijk imperious at the back and Charlie Lovren wisely staying away from his calamity of a left foot, the solid Froth smelt blood and got their rewards late in the game.\nAfter some pinball in the box, the ref soon made up for not awarding the Froth a blatant penalty in the first half by giving a soft handball. R9 Rosario was quick to grab the ball and showed his big game cohones as he drilled the ball into the net harder, sending the Froth support into rapture.\nThe drama wasn’t done yet though, as a mistimed tackle gave Sudakas a chance to whip a free kick in on goal with the last few minutes ebbing away. On a hat trick, the Sudakas no. 10 curled one for the far corner, but Ryan Dudek pulled off a top draw save to tip the effort round the post.\nWith what was the last kick of the game, the ball was in the net again from the resulting corner, but chalked off after the Sudakas centre mid clattered through a few Froth bodies. Finally fed up with all the opposition\u0026rsquo;s pissing and moaning, the ref called it early and the Ascot Park ditch ran blue with pure Froth.\n","permalink":"/posts/2020/2020-season-game-4/","tags":null,"title":"2020 Season - Game 4"},{"categories":["Match"],"contents":"Another rough day at the office for the frother boys.
